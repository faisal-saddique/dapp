The programme is named Cringe or Cool?. The subtitle of the programme is Brought to you by Dogtooth™. Description: Cringe or Cool?, invites 10 artists to explore the theme of Cringe. Design functions in the chasm between the old and the new, and often follows a cyclical rhythm. We might tend to see the new as Cool and old as Cringe, but those descriptions can be reversed with equal validity.

What is Cringe?

«One might think that ‘Cringe’ is a phenomenon without explanation: a kind of revulsion reflex in face of a public demonstration of clumsiness or ignorance. The term has become the formula dedicated to designate a feeling that social networks have helped to make more common: ‘an indirect discomfort’»
- Robin James from Le cringe algorithmique, un outil de contrôle social

Fascinated by the extended effect of Cringe and the role it plays in design, the exhibit invites visitors to explore Cringe in our contemporary societal panorama and its influence on norms and trends. The exhibition features a series of installations curated from invited peers that explore various deep-dives of Cringe-Influenced objects and networks. From fashion to music, from memes to video games, the works challenge our prejudice with Cringe at the nucleus. The experience guides visitors through an active participatory scenography whereby you are prompted with choices to make between Cringe or Cool.

The programme is named In Season. The subtitle of the programme is “The seasons are what a symphony ought to be: four perfect movements in harmony with each other.” – Arthur Rubinstein. But are we still “IN SEASON”?. Description: This year we teamed up with Regina Fischer; an illustrator based in Berlin (Germany) to realise a sparkling, colourful exhibition in our studio that is 100% built from leftovers we collect during our production.

A visual statement.

At first sight “In Season” is about spectacle, mesmerizing reflections, colours and light …. but after taking a closer look we tell you a story to make you reflect on the reality. Not only the weather is changing, also our way of life, the appearance of the landscape and the conscious use of resources. With the strong graphics and the bright colors, we dive into a "happy new world", which contains another level at a second look. We illustrate the data and consequences of climate change in an extraordinary way.

A journey into the world of tomorrow

How do we want to live in the near future, what do we pay attention to now when dealing with the nature available to us? Come with us on a journey into the world of tomorrow that has already begun.
At studio mo man tai we are known colorful design products that put a smile on the customer's face ...but every year during Dutch Design Week we take part with a personal project/installation; without any commercial intent – meaning that once a year we do not focus on customer requirements or such but realize an installation (together with business partners) that communicates a set of values that are important to us.

A glimpse behind the curtains

This year we teamed up with Regina Fischer; an illustrator based in Berlin (Germany) to be able to realize a colourful, sparkling installation in our studio at the Hastelweg in Eindhoven. We invite the visitor to also have a "glimpse behind the curtains" and show how our products are produced - all locally and 'fair'; a standard that comes naturally to us!
At mo man tai we share a passion for colours, materials and haptics and challenge each other with the search for new, creative and sustainable solutions. We love to “get our hands dirty” and see how a design develops. We believe this contributes significantly to our designs becoming freer and more intuitive and hopefully more spectacular. We believe it is important to maintain optimism and keep striving for positivism - otherwise we run the risk that confidence towards the future falters.

About studio mo man tai
In 2000 Industrial Designer Ulrike Jurklies decided to start her own brand. A few years later she moved to the Netherlands and since 2005 the company is based in Eindhoven. Apart from developing and maintaining the portfolio of mo man tai, Ulrike regularly teams up with various companies to curate installations and cooperate on projects.

The programme is named Growable Graphics. The subtitle of the programme is Graphic Design of the future - Introducing Biophilic Graphic Design through a sustainable signage system. Description: Growable Graphics is a signage concept demonstrating a live example of "Biophilic Graphic Design": fusing biology with design, showcasing how our graphic design of the future can look if we would take inspiration from nature and collaborate with it.

Imagine our graphics as little eco-systems

This project was born with the urge, to escape the niche of today's graphic design which is mostly used for commercial promotion, and to give it a broader purpose by shifting the place where it lives and how it's being used.
Biophilic design, the use of natural elements to mimic natural surroundings, is known to improve people's mental health, productivity and overall well-being. It can also have environmental benefits such as temperature control in cities and improved biodiversity.
As this new design trend is mostly represented in building-related disciplines or fashion, the designer of this project had the vision to fuse biophilic design with her discipline of graphic design and created a new design style: Biophilic Graphic Design.
It answers questions such as: How can we co-exist with other species, improve biodiversity in cities and manufacture our graphics without harmful techniques?
"Growable Graphics" is a live example of this new design style.

About the signage system

This signage system contains out of hexagon-shaped tiles that are covered with local moss and lichen species and can get used for letters, numbers, arrows and other shapes. Improving the local biodiversity, the tiles live on the venue's rooftop over the year and get harvested for the events. Thanks to the wood's geometric shape, they can get arranged and combined in an endless variety. The tiles can get used over and over without creating any waste, while hopefully sucking in more carbon than their production would have emitted. As the product is biodegradable, improves the local biodiversity as well as the air quality and doesn‘t produce any waste, it is a great example of how nature-inspired graphic design of the future could look if we rethink our current design approach and create products for long-term goals instead of following fast-fashion trends. Purpose of the project is to connect people with nature within urban spaces and to raise awareness for the potential of bio-infused design.

The programme is named The space between us. The subtitle of the programme is Shifting focus from objects to relationships. Description: Who or what determines the function of an object? Is a chair still a chair if it is exhibited in a museum? Maker, place and context: they determine the meaning of an object. The space between us questions the function of design and the role of the museum.

Relational Design

The space between us stretches across ten rooms of the Van Abbemuseum's historical building. Works by artists and designers from the museum's collection coincide with works on loan, including a number of works by Design Academy Eindhoven alumni. The starting point of the exhibition is relational design. This form of design explores the influence of objects and their design processes. For example, Finnegan Shannon questions the accessibility of museums. This maker places wooden benches in the exhibition, with texts on them such as 'This exhibition has asked me to stand for too long. Sit if you agree'. The benches are meant for visitors who, for whatever reason, want to take a rest.

Don't just watch, participate

The space between us challenges you not only to look, but also to participate. Start interacting with the works you see, the spaces in which they are located and the visitors you encounter. For example, play a game of table football on the FeetBall Rietveld Table by Surasi Kusolwong. In his work you see Dutch clogs and a Gerrit Rietveld table; two internationally renowned examples of Dutch design. With his design, the artist makes you think about the nationalistic character of the sport.

Embassy of Inclusive Society

The space between us was created in collaboration with the Embassy of Inclusive Society. Embassy of Inclusive Society is part of World Design Embassies, a programme of the Dutch Design Foundation. Embassy of Inclusive Society sees inclusion as a continuous process of learning and unlearning. What skills and habits should we keep or let go of in order to live together in a good way? And what role do designers and design have in this? With installations, activities and experiments you can practice your inclusivity muscle.

Creators
The exhibition features work by: Afonso de Matos / Aydan Murtezaoğlu / Alice Watel / Bik Van der Pol / Can Altay / Carl Andre / Comfort Ball / Community Couture & Snootie Studios / El Lissitzky / Enzo Mari / Finnegan Shannon / Gabriel Fontana / Gerrit Rietveld / Joe Scanlan / Koki Tanaka / Lana Čmajčanin / Leon de Lange / Li Mu / Luna Maurer / Piero Gilardi / Radha D'Souza & Jonas Staal / Robert Glas / Sarah Ross / Studio Corvers / SUPERFLEX / Surasi Kusolwong / Tadhg Read / Tania Bruguera / Tord Boontje / Umbrella Movement / Yassine Ben Abdallah.

The programme is named Crafted Liberation. The subtitle of the programme is An exhibition by women of Iran, repurposing their head scarves into stadium seats to highlight their resilience and quest for gender equality.. Description: An exhibition to immerse visitors in the experiences of Iranian women. The stadium seats, composed of recycled headscarves generously contributed by Iranian women from around the world, stands as a visual representation of the unity and shared struggle against political and societal constraints.

Collective Action to Initiate Change

Women's rights continue to be a pressing global issue, as demonstrated by a recent situation in Iran. In September ‘22, Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman, died while in custody of the Iranian moral police for a perceived headscarf violation. This incident triggered a widespread outcry and people courageously took to the streets demanding justice for Amini, although their brave actions carried the risk of arrest and political persecution. As an initiative to give voice to those who otherwise must remain silent, we initiated a collective call for action and asked Iranian women from all over the world to send us their unwanted headscarves. Their contributions led to the creation of the exhibited stadium seats and collectively we transform a traditional symbol of oppression to a beacon of empowerment.
The ban on Iranian women attending men's sporting events in stadiums was in place starting from 1981. It was justified on the grounds of preserving modesty and preventing inappropriate mixing between genders. We aim to re-imagine the seats, making them from scarves that symbolize a deep-rooted oppression and now being rejected by many Iranian women around the globe.

Stadium Seats As Objects of Empowerment

The centrepiece of the exhibition will be a series of stadium seats which are crafted from repurposed headscarves. Through a process of design and refinement, supported by Australian industry partners Talon Industries and Defy Design, a distinctive combination of compressed headscarves and recyclable polymers has been formulated. By employing compression molding techniques, the resulting material takes shape, while simultaneously preserving a connection to the historical legacy of stadium seats which are traditionally constructed from composite materials. The headscarves of all those Iranian women eventually allows us to create the exhibited grandstand and pictures a future where headscarves are no longer obligatory, a utopian vision where the resilience of women prevails. The recycled headscarf grandstand then becomes a potent emblem of this future, embodying the shift from enforced tradition to emboldened liberation.

Collaboration with Innovative Australian Manufacturing Partners

This exhibition was made possible through collaboration with Australian manufacturing partners.

Talon Technology is a Sydney-based company specializing in the development of innovative products, materials and processes. To bring plastic reprocessing to even the smallest communities, Talon initiated the local plastic microfactory (LPM) project. Using their knowledge of pressure molding and fiber reinforcing they have created a patented process called ‘WasticFibre’. This is a composite material that combines fabrics with recycled plastic bags to create a malleable composite sheet. The polymer acts as a consolidation matrix within the part to merge the fabric layers together, while the fabric provides structural integrity and an original aesthetic.

Defy is a Sydney-based company specializing in the design and manufacture of impactful products made from plastic destined for landfill, with a mission to stop the production of new plastic and keep all existing materials in circulation. Utilizing their proprietary sheet-press, we experimented with creating sheets made from a blend of shredded post-consumer plastic and scarves, and finally bending the flat sheets into bucket seats.

The programme is named MESSMERIZING_CURIOSITY SETS THINGS IN MOTION. The subtitle of the programme is Don't end me here, take me there, and let me evolve to a whole new level. Description: A curated space set up as a total experience. Enhancing the space and its forms with unique collectibles and a special scenography.  A mini district with a maximalistic surreal feel of curious objects and designs telling stories.  Placemaking this empty NS space at DDW23 as nomad gallery.

Curiosity sets things in motion

MESSMERIZING is a contemporary exhibition, blurring boundaries between design & experience art by objects that create curiosity
MESSMERIZING is minidistrict to wonder about while sparking joy
MESSMERIZING is a project by Sandra Keja Planken & Job Keja
MESSMERIZING started in 2022 as a pop up and continues in 2023 as a new design experience
MESSMERIZING operates as a nomadic gallery for the long run

About the concept: Curiosity sets things in motion. The whole reason we can look forward, create, invent and do is set on a base of childlike curiosity - the art of looking With this concept we like to show the importance of curiosity in all we do, design and create. Then, now and for the future to come. We give the visitors an invitation to go back to their own curiosity. What is created and why? What materials are used and why? What is the story behind it? And let visitors wonder around free to create their own interpretation. Let the design district spark joy, curiosity and mesmerize while thinking of then and the future.

About the participants: with crossovers between design, art, graphic, 3D and fashion we go to show past, present and future can intertwine.

Curiosity

With 2 floors of 650m2 we are setting up a different experience than last year. Showing a top floor with enlarged scaled objects between a curated scenography. And a 1st floor with combined sets. For visitors to travel from a large scaled installation and functional usable objects.

The programme is named Tony - Refrigeration with evaporative cooling. The subtitle of the programme is Tony is based on the principle of evaporating cooling without electricity and refrigerates food that should not be stored in the refrigerator.. Description: The porous clay absorbs the water from the water tank and, as it evaporates, cools the interior to 13-17 °C, creating optimal storage conditions for selected food. The simple use is intended to encourage users to engage with food storage and inform them about more sustainable consumption.

Background

Tony is born from an experimental and scientific approach to the material clay and meant for the correct storage of selected foods. It creates an ideal storage environment for foods that on one hand a fridge is too cold for and that on the other spoil more quickly at room temperature.
Some fruit and vegetables are sensitive to cold and lose their flavor if stored in temperatures that are too low. The lower temperatures also inhibit post-ripening processes. Other fruits and vegetables just need to be stored gently. Foods that spoil because of incorrect storage make up the majority of avoidable food waste. With Tony selected fruits and vegetables stay fresh longer than they would in the refrigerator or on the counter.

Design and Construction

Fruits and vegetables should generally be stored separately from each other. Tony is made up of a number of rectangular clay containers of different sizes that can be stacked on top of each other. Thus giving each group of produce its own place.

Intensive experiments with different types of clay and clay mixtures have shown that a Raku clay and sand mixture absorbs water from the water tank best and produces an optimal cooling effect. Each clay container consists of a water tank, a food container and a lid. This has the advantage that each clay complex works independently and with it's own water supply.

The surface of the outer wall is subtractively machined to increase the surface area. This allows more water to evaporate and the inside temperature to drop faster and further. As strong sunlight or standing next to a heat source can increase the internal temperature, a wooden construction allows the clay cooler to be placed flexibly in a convenient location in the household.

Sustainability and Circularity

Neither the extraction of the raw materials, the production of Tony or the use of the product release any substances harmful to the environment.
The Raku clay used in production is sourced from the Westerwald region of Germany, avoiding long transport routes and reducing CO2 emissions. Ceramics are made by firing a mixture of inorganic substances and are environmental friendly.

After production, the clay coolers are fired at the lowest possible temperature of 1000 °C in order to consume a minimum of energy.
The Tony clay cooler is an object for daily use. Therefore, it is built sturdily to last a long time. However, if the cooler is no longer intact or functional, clay coolers can be recycled by grinding them into fireclay. The fireclay can then be incorporated into clay bodies for the manufacture of new coolers.

The programme is named WasteBase | A new purpose for residual streams. The subtitle of the programme is A new purpose for residual streams. Description: The manufacturing of the products we use every day generates waste in the form of residual materials. These materials are often clean and of high quality, but end up in general waste. WasteBase increases the findability of these valuable materials, in order to stimulate repurpose.

Circular Design

WasteBase aims to tackle the problem of waste in the Dutch manufacturing industry by connecting manufacturers and designers in a new way to promote circularity. We provide a platform where manufacturers can offer their residual streams as valuable resources, enabling cost savings and reducing waste. Designers gain access to a wide range of leftover materials to create unique, circular products. If a material is tested and deemed suitable, WasteBase facilitates direct connections between parties for larger-scale collaborations. Successful collaborations are then showcased on our platform to inspire and motivate others.

Mission

Our goal is to create a society where material-driven design and repurposing are the norm, while virgin materials are only used as a last resort. By promoting circularity and reducing waste, WasteBase aims to contribute to several Sustainable Development Goals, such as responsible consumption and production, climate action, and sustainable cities and communities. This vision brings benefits by fostering a more sustainable and resource-efficient world, where the value of materials is maximized, waste is minimized, and environmental impacts are reduced.

The programme is named Spacefarming. The subtitle of the programme is The future of food. Description: Next Nature presents Spacefarming: the future of food at the Evoluon. The exhibition explores how we can grow our food differently in the future, on Earth, as well as in space.

How to feed 10 billion people in 2050?

The number of people on Earth is growing rapidly and is expected to increase to some 10 billion by 2050. This means that more food will be needed than we can produce today. Where will this food come from? And how will it be made? A hamburger of cultured meat, milk from a robot cow, or potatoes from space. Things you may associate with a distant future, but farmers, scientists, entrepreneurs, artists and designers are already developing innovative ways to turn this into reality. Spacefarming explores the future of food and agriculture. Welcome to the world of the space farmer.

The programme is named Een eerlijke start voor de generatie van morgen. The subtitle of the programme is Invest in the first 1000 days of life - counted from conception to second birthday - and contribute to more resilient generations. Description: Step into the magical world of the first 1000 days. Listen to one of our exercises - about how, as a caregiver, you can build a connection with your baby in the womb - and explore the science of linguistic development.

The research and design agency focused on the first 1000 days of life

In the coming decades, we will increasingly face complex societal challenges. Buikpraat facilitates the connection between caregivers, designers, theoretical and practical organizations, allowing them to collectively make a difference. The earlier the positive impact, the greater the societal gain. We facilitate a movement from isolated islands into one collective. 'Now' is the time for everyone – caregivers and organizations – to work together for a fair start for tomorrow's generation.

Caregivers often want to do more to contribute to the development of their child but don't always know how. This is a shame, because there is a lot of scientific and practical knowledge available about parenting and children's development. However, this knowledge typically doesn't reach the most important group: the caregivers themselves.

By using social design techniques, Buikpraat is able to map the living environment and needs of (expecting) parents. We translate scientific insights into practical exercises and manageable knowledge. In doing so, we build a bridge between science and practice.

About Buikpraat
Buikpraat is a research and design agency focused on the crucial beginning of life - the first 1000 days. Founded by Olga van Lingen and Lotte Jonkergouw.

The programme is named Gas to Green. Description: This project was awarded Special Mention in Streetlife Design Competition 2023, organized by Streetlife in collaboration with Landezine.

The project proposes a new kind of typology of urban farming that can, in a design sense, act as a landmark.

Lost site

As urban designers, landscape architects, and visual artist, we are concerned about the future of gas stations, as over 4,000 will be lost in the Netherlands by 2035 due to the electric transition.

Gas station network plays an important role in nowadays urban structure. They were designed to be reachable rapidly by car and form a complete network with a certain distance in between. You can see them anywhere throughout the country: On the side of streets, next to highways, in the CBD, in the residential areas, in the nature reserve and so on.

What is the future of these gas stations? We start to panic because they will not just be lost sites but lost networks.

We found the answer in history. The gas station is just an evolution of rest stations for travellers. Horses need grass, and cars need gas. Gas stations were designed to have high accessibility. What could this accessibility be used for in the future?

Gas to green

We envision repurposing these lost sites as urban farms, inspired by their historical function as rest stations for travellers. The accessibility of gas station networks perfectly aligns with the principles of urban agriculture, efficiently providing 'food' to city dwellers. By converting gas stations into urban farms, we can create hubs for public use, preserving these spaces from being forgotten. To facilitate this transformation, our project, Gas to Green, aims to utilize the two most common gas station types - those at highway exits and in neighbourhoods. We view this initiative as a design and manifesto, urging young designers to think ahead and find solutions for impending challenges. As we progress in the electric transition, let us turn these lost sites into thriving urban farms - an innovative way to address environmental concerns and ensure a sustainable future.

As the old Chinese saying: Great fortune follows upon disaster. Gas to green!

The programme is named PERPETUUM MOBILE by KIKI X JOOST. The subtitle of the programme is The workshop as a self-propelled machine where creations flow endlessly and each action triggers a reaction.. Description: Perpetuum Mobile: perpetual motion. Kiki and Joost's workshop operate as a living, breathing entity. It embodies the essence of perpetual motion, a captivating symphony where ideas flow, ideas transform, and the creative energy propels their endeavors forward.

Revealing the poetry of a self-propelled creative workflow, with creativity at its very core.

Perpetuum Mobile is a hypothetical device that generates continuous motion without an external energy source. Figuratively, It symbolizes ongoing inspiration and creativity. Kiki & Joost's workshop operates with the precision of a finely tuned machine. It moves autonomously, akin to a symphony where an unbroken rhythm resonates through their creations. The creative process flows dynamically and perpetually, with each action giving rise to a reaction. Their hands-on approach and constant reflection are intricately intertwined, forming a symbiotic relationship known as "Thinking Hands." Fearlessly, they dare to reinvent traditional crafts, exploring sculptural techniques and remaining steadfast in their commitment to the analog way of working that underpins all their projects. Their dedication to minimizing the use of technology is evident as they embrace the brilliance of working with their hands and intuition, supported by their exceptional team.
During this year's DDW, they showcase the poetic beauty of creation and the dynamic nature of works in progress. Their exhibition epitomizes boundless creativity, embodying a perpetual motion of inspiration—a true "Perpetuum Mobile.”

About KIKI X JOOST
Kiki and Joost work individually and jointly putting creativity at the heart of it all, from what they do, to how they do it. Their workshop is a massive space dedicated to the production of unique pieces in a practice that allows space for intuition and instinct. Regardless of the scale, handmade and human touch remains at the heart of their process reinforcing a physical approach to contemporary design. They run Studio Thinking Hands, a core studio within Design Academy Eindhoven’s BA program.

The programme is named Illuminating Landscapes. The subtitle of the programme is The intertwining of languages. Description: Studio Liselot Cobelens and Bureau Streekk collaborated for the municipality of Maashorst on the development of a new, unifying language of landscapes. "Illuminating Landscapes" showcases the impact of climate change and the urgency of speaking a shared language.

Changing landscapes

Landscape conditions are constantly changing. The way the landscape is arranged is not resistant to changes in the climate pattern. The natural and human system will experience the effects and this must be anticipated. In addition, different opinions can increase polarization and inequality in the Netherlands. It is therefore necessary to transform these systems.
Climate change is happening faster than previously thought. No one can deny that last summer was dominated by the severe weather exacerbated by climate change, with forest fires, severe weather, floods, flooding and drought dominating the news.

The idea is that the Netherlands is going to have the same Mediterranean climate as Italy, for example, this is incorrect. The soil and water system cannot be compared to those of other countries. What does the landscape have to offer us in terms of opportunities and challenges in relation to climate change? Why are these climate effects present in a particular location? How can we transform to a shared vision of the future?

Understanding each other's languages

Citizens, farmers, entrepreneurs, civil servants, aldermen, researchers and policy makers all deal with the landscape and have each developed their own language for it. These languages are often far apart, making it difficult to communicate efficiently. The technical language of a researcher, for example, differs enormously from the poetic language of the citizen and the actual situation.

The landscape is often perceived as a complex system. The landscape twists, cracks and bubbles up wherever it is given space. A climate coaster simplifies this complex system and makes the opportunities and challenges related to climate understandable. The climate overlay forms the basis for the installation, allowing everyone to gain insight into the area.
Illuminating landscapes connects the different languages of the past, present and future. Commissioned by the Municipality of Maashorst, a cut-out of an area with diverse landscape and cultural phenomena was chosen. The area is characterized by the fracture system, which causes different contrasts between high, low, wet and dry.

Interweaving

Discover the new language of landscape and experience the first "Illuminating Landscapes."

The installation weaves together a carpet, lighting and Augmented Reality. The circular landscape carpet visualizes the area in a tangible way. It is already in the name of the project: the landscape is literally put in a different light, interweaving different languages. By combining an everyday object like a carpet with LED lighting, it has become possible for us to show movements in the landscape at a glance. In the process, effects of climate change are made transparent. The wire heights in the carpet are based on the characteristics of the landscape. Colors in the installation show where it gets drier and wetter.

By scanning the Qr code you enter the interactive Augmented Reality environment and discover how water flows through the landscape. Three landscape tiles show the unique workings of the horst, fractures and valley and valley.


Illuminating landscapes weaves a new landscape language where the invisible is literally made visible.

The programme is named PRIMAL A.I.. The subtitle of the programme is A critical staging of Artificial Intelligence as an extractive tool for design. Description: In »Primal A.I.« A204 takes a closer look at the contemporary emergence of artificial intelligence. Different machine learning models are used to establish a symbolic link between A.I. and its human origin by creating conceptual tools of extraction and labour through and for artificial intelligence.

HUMAN ↔ A.I.

Behind the mystical phrase ‘artificial intelligence’ one finds a global machine that is neither artificial nor intelligent. In fact, its origins are of a very human nature. The development process of artificial intelligence begins with sedimentary rocks that are partially extracted from the earth by manual labour before they are processed into technology metals through chemical and physical separation processes. The further path to the development of artificial intelligence is paved by multiple levels of exploitation and extraction.

Therefore, should artificial intelligence not rather be critically illuminated and seen as the result of extractive and exploitative human practices?

ABOUT PRIMAL A.I.

In »Primal A.I.«, artificial intelligence is used to critically stage its own origin. Three conceptual tools emphasise the extraction of raw materials and the manual labour involved.
The tools were created through experimental work with different machine learning models, aiming to create a novel process that supports a collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence in the creation of physical artefacts.

The programme is named Death, Taxes, & Advertisements. The subtitle of the programme is An inquiry into the mining of the 21st century's most precious commodity: attention.. Description: The phrase "Death and Taxes" is perhaps most famously quoted by Benjamin Franklin, "but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes." This project suggests an update to the dated idiom: Death, Taxes, & Advertisements. Do I have your undivided attention?

Unveiling the Attention Economy

In an era characterized by digital immersion and constant connectivity, advertising has seamlessly woven itself into the fabric of our daily lives, emerging as an inevitable and integral method of capitalizing on the most precious commodity of our generation: attention. As the adage goes, "If you're not paying for the product, you are the product." Instead, we "pay" with our attention. This trade-off, free content for targeted ads, sustains the digital ecosystem. Attention fuels capitalism's engine, a modern certainty like Death and Taxes. Whether we're scrolling through social media feeds, exploring search engine results, or indulging in online videos, the moments we allocate to these activities are meticulously tracked, analyzed, and ultimately transformed into valuable currency within the economic engine of advertising. Understanding the interplay of content, commerce, and ethics in this attention economy is vital. But as we navigate this new world, a looming question remains… Are we truly aware of the value we exchange for the digital world's offerings?

The programme is named Weapons of Mass Seduction. The subtitle of the programme is Embrace the cringeworthy element of gaming display. Description: Imagine you are about to hit third base with your date, they walk you through the corridor of their shared apartment and…surprise! An epic prop wall with carefully refined videogame weapons hanging on it stands in front of your eyes. Are you cringed or are you amazed? Do you leave or do you stay?

Many passionate people do not play video games just to kill some time but have a fully rounded passion and the collection of gaming props can be one distinctive and intriguing part of this pastime.

Weapon props have a cringe yet exciting cool factor. What is creepier than the fetishisation of devices that have one purpose: murder? And is not it even weirder to think that adults would dedicate their intimate spaces to cultivate a temple of gaming build upon those gadgets?

A full-fledged geek is proud to share the fruits of their labour with the world after spending countless hours collecting or even designing props, taking their enthusiasm for virtual weapons to a whole new level of obsession.

The programme is named A Cringe a Day Keeps Platform Capitalism Away. The subtitle of the programme is The cringe calendar is designed for those who are chronically online, making their stomachs churn and eyes squint.. Description: Instagram is fun, but the pendulum is seemingly shifting away from posting on the grid.

The Only Way Forward

Before we get hooked on the next platform serving it better, it's time to look back. Like when people would earnestly poll their followers whether they should cut bangs or not? Or that urge to post a no-makeup selfie yet boldly acknowledge that you're not wearing any makeup.

The success of this calendar is measured by how difficult it is for the participant to get through the daily cringe-posting tips. I assure you that after the last tip of this calendar, platform capitalism will feel a lot more meaningless. This calendar can be an excellent gift to those chronically online struggling to know where to go next. Because sometimes, the only way forward is to look back and cringe.

The programme is named The Meme Bootcamp. The subtitle of the programme is Transform yourself and learn how to harness the power of memes to process your worst, cringiest, and anxiety-inducing moments as designer and artist.. Description: Meme making as therapy? As an extraordinary bottom-up form of expression they can also be extremely helpful to self-reflect and process difficult moments at work and in life. But how? Daniel and Elena will teach you during the 30-minute Meme Bootcamp. Enlist today - Not for the faint of heart!

The Meme Bootcamp

Meme making as therapy? Yes, you read that right. Memes are an extraordinary bottom-up form of expression - they can also be extremely helpful to self-reflect and process difficult moments at work and in life. Just translate them into humoristic symbols. But how? The Meme Bootcamp is just what you need – learn through a 30-minute workshop the meme-making skills to process your worst, cringiest, and most anxiety-inducing moments in your professional design and art career.

A Cleansing of Sorts

We want to help young creatives, who face topical challenges of overworking, creating awareness conversation pieces, and the constant quest for positionality and design methodology, while trying to appease your biggest client. We believe that setting up a mirror in front of ourselves can create a therapeutic value - a cleansing of sorts - of all the cringe you’ve encountered as a designer, artist, and young creative person.

Enlist Today!

The Meme Bootcamp is here to guide you. Inspired by the absurdities of modern (design) work, such as design sprints, bodystormings, designathons, and standups, we want to create a similar challenge for our participants. We see it as a collective performance, where we are your boot camp instructors, coaching you step by step to meme therapy success. Your goal is to create a meme that will participate in a voting contest on our Instagram account. The winner is awarded a celebratory turtleneck dickey, to transform every life situation into a turtleneck-wearing professional designer moment.

The programme is named Minecraft Story Mode is Cool. The subtitle of the programme is Minecraft is one of the world's best-selling games, and having been part of its community, I'd like to share some of the things that inspire me.. Description: In Minecraft, losing your possessions in survival mode isn't just punishment. It's something deeper: everything you once held dear, emerges in a silent choreographed revolution. The artist, as if under a fatal spell, bursts into flames, leaving behind all his possessions. Don't worry, he'll respawn.

Minecraft the game.

Minecraft, the sandbox game, reveals a non-linear narrative that invites insatiable curiosity and limitless creativity. In this game world, losing your most prized possessions in survival mode isn't just a punishment. No, it's something deeper: everything you wear, everything you once held dear, emerges in a silent dance, a choreographed revolution. The objects, those essential elements, detach themselves from the fabric of the world, springing to life in an aerial levitation. They waltz and twirl, signaling the site of the tragedy.

The project

However, here on Earth, our personal possessions do not have this dancing spirit. They remain in the background, discreet, for those who do not cultivate intimacy with them. This installation materializes the invisible gears of these video game universes.
You have just connected to the "Cring is Cool" card. The artist himself, as if under a fatal spell, bursts into flames, leaving behind all his possessions. Don't worry, he'll respawn.

The programme is named Midocracy Sinkhole Vortex. The subtitle of the programme is Welcome to the Midocracy Sinkhole Vortex. Here, we are all mid.. Description: The Midocracy Sinkhole Vortex is an irl structure emulating online phenomena which have percolated into our collective western subconscious and found itself distributed all around us.

Mid ⎻ short for mediocre.

Fringing satire and ethnography while participating in self-conscious stimulating navel-gazing, the Midocracy Sinkhole Vortex is a sculptural multimedia display of questions of class structures and dynamics, emotional triggers, computational systems infiltrating the material world, and the circulation of cultural capital.

Midocracy

Midocracy is the special place where cool has percolated through the underground to finally vegetate on the margins of cringe. In the midocracy access holds the most and the least currency, concepts are tokenised and style is monetised, absolutely nothing doesn’t have a price tag and everything is up for grabs.

About ULTRA
ULTRA met in a garden where they avoided each other's gaze until they
both needed a lighter - the rest is fantasy. Fast cars, mechanical fastenings, and the sublime subconscious are some of the elements which bond ULTRA in co-creation.

The programme is named Alkaloid Dream. Description: The seeds derived from Areca trees encompass alkaloids. In Taiwan, the betel nut industry has become an issue that the government must remediate, given its pervasive overindulgence. These installations encapsulate contradictory aspirations through the betel nut industry’s visual language.

Betel Nut

The seeds derived from Areca trees encompass alkaloids, notably arecaidine, and arecoline. Upon mastication, these compounds yield intoxicating, addictive, and carcinogenic effects. This botanical specimen elicits augmented alertness, energy, euphoria, and relaxation, exhibiting psychoactive parallels to nicotine.

Taiwan's betel nut industry's roots date to the 1970s, concurrent with modernization. The government initiated construction to boost the economy, while urbanization led to rural labor shortages. Farmers adapted crops due to global trade lowering values. This confluence of industrial change and agriculture spurred betel nut growth, noted for ease and profitability. The burgeoning working class, enticed by its sensory appeal, heightened demand.

Paradigm shift

Modernization, an integral facet of human progress, is commonly perceived as a problem-solving process. Nevertheless, in Taiwan, the betel nut industry has inadvertently transpired as a byproduct of modernization—become an issue that the government must remediate present-day, given its pervasive overindulgence.

To those fragments abandoned during the infinite journey of a “superior future.”

This project serves as a reflective prism, refracting the contentious aspects intrinsic to Taiwan's betel nut industry and cultural milieu while simultaneously interrogating the ostensibly linear progression within society. Through the amalgamation of visual language drawn from the betel nut industry, these installations encapsulate contradictory aspirations of society.

The programme is named DOUBLE DIP. The subtitle of the programme is An exclusive underground audio-visual conversation piece. Description: "DOUBLE DIP is a commentary on the pseudo glamorous and self-indulgent lifestyle of the next generation of star designers. Thank you. No further comments."

PRESS RELEASE - Eindhoven, NL

Undiscovered artist/beatmaker/social designer/rapper SLEMMADILEMMAEMMA releases an exclusive underground audio-visual conversation piece. DOUBLE DIP is a commentary on the pseudo glamorous and self-indulgent lifestyle of the next generation of star designers. SLEMMA shares personal anecdotes from inside "the bubble", where everyone knows everyone, and no one knows anyone else.

// And I already fucked your roomie / Tendency to double dip so sue me / Staying in the bubble when the weather is gloomy //

“If you know you know,” SLEMMA describes, “but yeah, you don’t have to get it to get it.” According to the artist herself, the experimental lo-fi EDM beat was conceived in the midst of eating bread with Albert Hein hummus and stresscrying about midterms. The music video features artistically dressed artists in a homogenous TikTok/90s inspired dance choreography, which the artist also takes all credit for. With the track, she wishes to create awareness of a serious matter: “All these people of Eindhoven just consider us a big group of design-school students. But each of us is in fact EXTREMELY unique, and it’s honestly about time that the locals here comprehend that."

The programme is named Eat Dust. Description: This work reimagines the once-controversial elements of the '90s import car culture. Its goal is to recapture the lost symbolism that represented identity and belonging. It involves the destruction and aestheticization of corporate logos, to gain a deeper connection to personal identity.

Car Culture

In the 1990s cars served as an extension of cultural identity for Asian American communities, standing in opposition to the idealizing white American lifestyle. The import modified car aesthetic in Los Angeles represented this resistance, using customizations to stand out and differentiate themselves from mainstream values and norms. However, now we often associate this aesthetic with the obnoxious and hyper-masculine trends of that time, resulting in the loss of its original meaning and leaving a bitter aftertaste.


This work aims to reimagine and revitalize the once-controversial elements of the '90s import car culture. Its goal is to reclaim their cultural value and reshape them, recapturing the lost symbolism that represented identity and belonging. It involves the destruction and aestheticization of corporate logos, appropriating these symbols driven by consumerism to gain a deeper connection to personal identity.

Metal

ripped metal,

In the metal version I was interested in working organically with metal. Where metal is often an industrially sleek material, new techniques also provide opportunities to change this. Using these techniques, we came up with the idea of blending the organic world with sleek industrial design products. With some "tug-of-war" between us and the manufacturer, this turned out to be realizable. We present this new series of cabinets, chairs, benches and crates in Hall-G at sectie-c.

The programme is named The Green Clean / De groene schoonmaak. The subtitle of the programme is People with a distance from the jobmarket bring sustainability, greening and reuse closer to you. Description: People with intellectual disabilities reduce complex issues to simple solutions. In their own way by rearranging existing objects in new design and by making natural cleaning products and clean air products. In this way we become a bit kinder to the earth.

People with an intellectual disability bring sustainability closer to you

'The green clean' is a social project by the disability organization Lunet and designer Edith Vervest of Sterkstijl. We believe it is important that our people participate, matter and grow. We believe that this is only possible in a society in which we think about reuse. We show in an accessible way how we deal with the themes of sustainability and greening.

Various Lunet craft workshops helped by thinking about this theme. They design and make usable products in which reuse and natural materials play the only role. This idea has even been implemented in the lunch and small snacks that are served. Throw nothing away, use everything is also the motto here.

Sometimes it seems that the theme of sustainability is far removed from people with an intellectual disability. But how surprising and special it is to experience that these people in particular can come up with simple solutions for complicated subjects. Call it green, sustainable. Don't pull but brush.

About Lunet
Lunet is a non-profit organization for people with intellectual disabilities. Lunet supports living, working, learning and leisure,
We work on the basis of quality of care with a good life as our focus.
Together we work towards an independent and fully-fledged place in society.

The programme is named Will Water Want. The subtitle of the programme is Investigating the will and voice of the Dommel River in designing an urban environment.. Description: In and around the Dommel river a series of objects interact with the flowing water, producing water swirls and sounds. A billboard on the riverbank shows a system analysis of the Dommel’s basin, an examination of human influences on the well-being of the river.

How to Design as Allies of a River?

The municipality of Eindhoven commissioned Land-Ally to make "The Voice of the Dommel" heard in the area's urban developments. "Will Water Want” inquires how to design in alliance with the Dommel. The work explores the possibility of collaborating with a river, and how to listen to this non-human entity without reducing it to a mere object or appropriating it for human-centric interests.

How can the Dommel River become a designer of the landscape it flows through? How can a scientific perspective contribute to designing a city in alliance with Nature? What questions can you ask to imagine yourself in an impossible conversation with the Dommel? To explore these questions, the project takes the shape of a site-specific work consisting of a billboard and interactive installation.

Objects Interacting with the Stream

The spatial installation consists of a series of tools for the river to interact with. Glass sculptures sit in the stream through which the water flows, creating different swirls. Alongside the riverbank water flutes are attached to the railing. Here, you can place your ear onto a ceramic-shell and listen to the sounds produced by the water flowing past the tip of the flutes.

Facing this water symphony is a billboard featuring a visual investigation of the Dommel. By applying the Land-Ally research method, Marte Mei, on behalf of Land-Ally, concluded that the river no longer had a voice or agency in the Eindhoven’s centre, having been completely contained by human constructions, forms of regulation and pollution elsewhere in the river. Marte Mei worked with aquatic ecologist Jip de Vries on a system analysis of the river catchment, to find out what adjustments would need to be made on a larger scale to improve the river's ecosystem.

The Billboard

The Billboard showcases a system analysis of the Dommel River, focussing on 5 locations along the stream. These examples show the impact humans have had on the river through three perspectives: the Scientist, the 'Land-Ally' and the River itself.

The Scientific approach: investigating the Dommel River and its connected ecosystems, stating the ecological facts about each location and the impact human interventions have on the water cycle.

The Land Ally approach: building a relationship with water without manipulating it for human purposes, and instead promoting a more egalitarian collaboration. Seeing the role of the human as one that can aid the river’s well-being and potential restoration.

The River perspective: engaging in a hypothetical 'dialogue' with water. What would you ask the river if you could?

By combining these three perspectives new design directions can be found that facilitate a more eco-centric design of urban landscapes. Designing with, rather than despite, the nonhuman inhabitants of the environment.

About Land-Ally
Land-Allyship stands for forming an alliance with non-human entities, such as plants, animals, water, or fungi. Land-Ally is a design methodology and foundation started by social designer Marte Mei van Haaster in 2021 and has since grown into a travelling concept based on site-specific research and landscape interventions.

The programme is named Divide Unite. The subtitle of the programme is A room divider where the design is determined by the available waste material.. Description: Our vision in this project is to create awareness about the value of reuse. The result of this can be seen in the series, Many shares of. During DDW we will show the translation in a room divider where the design is determined by the residual waste in collaboration with MONDiLAB.

Use of shapes

Our project began with a research on materials, waste and recycling, which resulted in a series of flat artworks with 3D elements. A series that consists of a triptych, which stems from earlier graphic work. It is a translation of our work in the flat printing surface to an XL 3D wall panel.

In the serie of which this triptych is part. We have used different materials. The whole series consist of works with different types of paper, textile, wooden panels, cardboard and carpet. Made from new and recycled materials. With the shapes we have, we are puzzling. We reuse all the remaining waste and incorporate it into new prints.

In this serie we use layers that together forms a landscape. Through the different layers. Depth is created. The playful shapes and use of color, characterizes our style.

The programme is named Heel de Wereldboom. The subtitle of the programme is The World Tree in Greendomain Wasven as a symbol of community building.. Description: Our World Tree has been burned. Het Wasven tries to preserve the monumental tree for future generations. The rescue is formed by a plaited tribe and bypass in the crown. The activities can be followed during DDW. Visitors can participate by making their own work from the prunings.

Tree with a podium

The volunteers of Wasven are committed to preserving their own living environment. Working together in nature creates synergy between the green and social domains. We are responsible for it and we are part of it. This is also reflected in “De Gevlekte Zuiderling”, a monumental plane tree in the green heart of the estate forest. The plane tree was crowned in 2009 as the first World Tree in the Netherlands. A tree that can live to be 1000 years old. Which means a lot to the community. A tree with a podium that protects the roots. Also as a podium for events, weddings and gatherings. A podium that has become fatal to the plane tree. Last year the podium and part of the tree burned down. The Wasven organizes actions to save the tree.

Plaited tribe offers support

Together with the municipality of Eindhoven and the WorldTree foundation, measures are being taken to safeguard the tree. Volunteers set up a crowdfunding campaign, reactions are pouring in. An international survey by veteran tree experts points the way to preserve the World Tree. New shoots grow at the base of the tribe. These will grow into a braided trunk that will embrace the old tree. The plaited tribe gives the tree something to hold onto and connects the community. The crown of the tree is secured by pruning and anchoring. By means of a bypass, the crown will live on and be anchored in the future. The bypass has been designed by tree experts in collaboration with local designers.

Crown on out work

The plaited tribe grows, as does the community. A second crowdfunding makes the bypass possible. The bypass along the trunk has recently been realized. Saving the crown takes shape during DDW by pruning the monumental branches, anchoring them and extending the bypass. The work in progress can be followed on site. Residents, artists and designers are asked to keep the tree alive and to connect it permanently with the community. The prunings are made available. Everyone can take a part of the World Tree to make their own work. The results and the story behind them will be bundled and presented later. Visitors are invited, together with the volunteers, to process the remaining prunings into branches with which we strengthen the green heart of the Wasven.

About Wasven

The programme is named Cycleau. The subtitle of the programme is Cycleau is a compact water treatment system designed to recycle wastewater to drinking water to promote a circular means of access to clean water.. Description: Around the world, challenges of water scarcity and pollution have affected local communities’ access to clean drinking water and safe waterways. As a strategic intervention, Cycleau offers point-of-use water treatment and wastewater recycling in a low-cost, retrofitted system designed for homes.

The Challenge: Global Water Scarcity and Pollution

Around the world, a trichotomy of challenges concerning water scarcity, drinking water contamination, and sewage pollution have compromised many communities’ ability to access clean drinking water and safe waterways. Communities globally depend on plastic bottled water and water trucks to meet their basic needs, causing cumulative stress on local ecosystems through increased carbon emissions, rising waste, and growing pressure on natural water resources.

Cycleau as a Low-Cost, Compact Water Treatment Solution

Cycleau is a compact greywater treatment system designed to retrofit below sinks, showers, and laundry units to capture and treat greywater for potable water reuse. The hardware unit, which is sized at 300 millimetres by 300 millimetres by 500 millimetres, connects to the drain pipe and water supply lines which are exposed below sinks, showers, and laundry units to redirect incoming municipal water supplies through a point-of-use treatment system that removes public water contaminants, while also collecting greywater for immediate treatment and purification to potable standards. To expand access to clean drinking water, Cycleau serves as a point-of-use treatment system where water can be filtered and purified immediately before it’s consumed. To reduce the systemic impacts of water scarcity and sewage pollution, Cycleau reduces the water footprints of buildings by reusing up to 20% greywater for potable reuse, while also treating up to 80% of remaining greywater to non potable standards before it’s discharged into open waterways. 

Scalability and Impact

Cycleau’s scalability is one to one, meaning its impact increases unit by unit. One unit of Cycleau conserves 60 litres per person per day, and treats up to 300 litres of wastewater to non-potable standards before discharge. When scaled up to 100 people, 600 litres of water are saved and 3000 litres of wastewater are treated. When scaled across one million users, Cycleau conserves 75 million litres of drinking water each day, and reduces 1 trillion litres of sewage pollution each year.

The programme is named Resting Reef: Restoring life through death. The subtitle of the programme is A sustainable death care service that transforms human ashes into beautiful reef structures to commemorate past lives, while building new life.. Description: We develop a unique formula containing bone ash and crushed oyster shells to create beautiful 3D-printed reef structures that are then deployed in the ocean to regenerate marine life. The reefs are then cared for and monitored, and we provide support and rituals to people to connect with nature.

Transforming a polluting and outdated industry

Death is killing our planet. Our current funeral and burial practices promote deforestation, excess use of polluting materials, and embalming fluids that seek into the groundwater.

At the same time, one of the world's most threatened marine habitats is native oyster reefs with 85% of them being lost due to human activities.

Resting Reef is not only aiming to reduce negative impacts, but generate positive ones. By promoting the oyster settlements, ocean water will be filtered, CO2 will be captured, coastal erosion will be reduced, and marine life will be regenerated.
By placing multiple reef structures next to each other on the seafloor, we create a stable foundation for an ecosystem to be successfully restored.

Honouring Life

Resting Reef is as much about providing a sustainable alternative to conventional burial and memorial methods, as it is about radically changing the way we perceive death. We create new rituals and traditions around death that celebrate life. Whether alone, with loved ones, or as part of a wider community, Resting Reef offers a new meaningful tradition of memorialising.

We believe death doesn’t have to be the final step in the journey, but a stage in nature's cycle of life. Giving back to earth in this way allows life to live on – both in memory and in nature.

A female-led team

Resting Reef is a startup co-founded by design duo Aura Murillo and Louise Skajem.

Aura is an Experience Designer with a dual Master's from the RCA and Imperial College London. Her work focuses on the intersection between design, art, and science with a strong focus on human behaviour to enhance meaning. With first-hand experience going through the death of his father, she felt motivated to develop projects exploring death. These projects gave her the ability to discuss and work with sensitive topics, engage and collect testimonies, and experience working with experts within mental health and deathcare services.

Louise is an interdisciplinary designer who uses material exploration and biomimicry as methods to design innovations that tackle wicked problems, like climate change. She has an MA/MSc in Global Innovation Design where she studied and experimented with seaweeds and oysters. Louise was selected as the 2023 Bio Design Fellow for the Arts Foundation in the UK.

The programme is named Learning innovation. The subtitle of the programme is Design that facilitates rich learning experiences. Description: Studio Tast consists of a multidisciplinary design team with a passion for learning. Our designers create contemporary learning experiences. Every solution is unique. From physical tools to interactive apps and everything in between. This Dutch Design Week we present three new designs.

Spiek Digital

Opdidakt has been helping children with various learning and behavioral problems for years. This includes children with dyslexia. They challenged Studio Tast to use today's technological possibilities to develop their knowledge into a contemporary treatment method. We transformed their paper method into an activating visual platform with interaction, gamification and animation.

DigiCase

With the Digicase, we activate children (ages 9 to 12) to make conscious choices in what technology they use and how they use it. And how they include their parents in the learning process. All children make a good digital start at the time in their lives when they increasingly use digital technology and online media independently.

De regeneratie reis

Regenerative medicine offers chronically ill people the prospect of a cure, rather than (expensive) symptom relief. Studio Tast developed in commission of LUMC and NWO four interactive setups to explain regenerative medicine to a wide audience. These setups explain four disease states that are being researched within regenerative medicine: diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and osteoarthritis.

About Studio Tast
Studio Tast consists of a multidisciplinary design team with a passion for learning. Our designers create contemporary learning experiences appropriate to your challenge. Every solution is therefore unique. From physical tools to interactive apps and everything in between. We challenge ourselves daily to experiment with new knowledge, technologies and materials. In order to always be ready for tomorrow's opportunities.

The programme is named BA Jewellery + MA Design & Future Making. The subtitle of the programme is Tactile Dialogs. Description: Feeling, touching, interacting with others and our surroundings, reflection, critical thinking and communication–that is what we are capable of. Celebrating the joy in craftsmanship in defining roles of design, BA Jewellery and MA Design & Future Making graduates invite us to experience and reflect.

BA Jewellery

We understand jewellery as the dynamic relationship between material, form, body and space. We explore the intersections of material development, evolving definitions of craftsmanship, old and new traditions and disrupt presumptive rules, resulting in works that engage and push the boundaries of preconceived notions. Vivian Manzardo‘s A Matter of Nipples conveys how social mores, many hypocritical, differentiate how we treat a physical attribute common to all genders and thus deny it‘s importance in giving essential sustenance and life. In Carnal Desire, Cécile Garcia explores the fascination of corporeal lushness and plays with our emotions from attraction to disgust.
Pforzheim Revisited Berlin, in collaboration with C. Hafner Precious Metal Techonology and the German Museum of Technology in Berlin, is part of the cultural project »Manufactory Production and Design of Jewellery«, registered by the German UNESCO commission as an example of Good Safeguarding Practices of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Alumni working with »old masters« and traditional Pforzheim jewellery manufacturing machines develop a wide array of new and contemporary forms of jewellery and objects.

MA Design & Future Making

The critical context of systems of culture, society, industry and environment is our playing field. Investigating meaningfulness and exploring questions, perceptions and ideas in a practical design environment, we experiment at the intersections of analog and digital making, virtuality and materiality, artistic and practice-based research processes. We question existing techniques, processes and methods and explore what „making“ means in the context of possible „futures“. Experimenting with recursion techniques in scanning and printing, Aylin Maus blurs the lines between analog and digital. Proposing the scavenger as an essential factor in circular sustainability, Bo Zhang‘s research and jewellery touch us viscerally. Elisabeth Klug‘s experimentation with carbon illuminates new facets to a misunderstood material, while Miriam Neukam seeks to reduce misunderstandings and encourage the constructive exchange of viewpoints in communities. In Sonja Keppler‘s sculptures the human and non-human collaborate in search of new approaches to form and aesthetics. And with »Inaninanimate«, Xiaomung Zhang explores the animate qualities of crafted objects and their role in our connection to them.

About Pforzheim University
Pforzheim University, School of Design is founded on the still relevant historical jewellery traditions of the city and region. This unique „making“ dna combined with an artistically free approach and critical thinking is committed to asking relevant questions and social responsability, informing our approach to Jewellery, material and technology and drives the practice-based, interdisciplinary and experiential exploring of socially relevant issues in Design & Future Making.

The programme is named Space Invaders. The subtitle of the programme is Architectural photography of abstract brutalist birdhouses and living garden birds. Description: Photographer Hans van Asch presents his new photo series Space Invaders in his studio. Live garden birds land in his backyard on self-made brutalist birdhouses. Bird's freedom versus abstract architectural forms give a dystopian character and raise questions about liveability.

Space Invaders

Space Invaders is the title of my second major bird series. The title initially seems to refer to the birds that land in the displays outside in the garden. After all, they are the 'intruders' in the photo setups. But in reality, the photographer and the birds enter each other's space. It is a battle between the position of the (hidden) worm and the artistic intentions of the photographer. Bird's freedom versus the abstract architectural forms give the series a dystopian character and raise questions about livability.

The programme is named Research to Reconnect. The subtitle of the programme is Researching and designing for a future proof everyday. Description: House of Thol creates functional products that make green living easier.
These are the tangible results of thorough research and material experiments.
This DDW we showcase the difference between the House of Thol Brand and Studio, paving the way for future collaborative research projects.

Researching to design a greener everyday

The starting point for each new House of Thol product is an everyday challenge: ‘How can we waste less food?’; ‘How can we successfully grow our own greens?’; Or ‘How do we keep our plants alive?’

We thoroughly research, hoard information from all angles, and experiment hands-on with sustainable materials and techniques.
We love this phase, diving into it head first, seeing where our curiosity leads us, and building a web of knowledge. Not only looking into How things are made, but also remaining conscious about Why they should be made.

Often, we only showcase the final result: the House of Thol Brand product in its finished packaging, ready for the store.
We aim to take you into our curiosity this Dutch Design Week and showcase House of Thol Studio as a partner for research projects into a green tomorrow.

About House of Thol

The programme is named Living Coffin. The subtitle of the programme is Here to enrich nature.. Description: The Living Coffin embodies living design in manufacturing, fostering biodiversity and nurturing the Earth. A testament to creating products that give back to nature, it's a model for a sustainable future.

A Sustainable Legacy for Future Generations

The Living Coffin by Loop Biotech is an innovative, sustainable burial solution that utilizes mushrooms and organic materials to redefine the end-of-life experience. Made from mycelium (the vegetative part of mushrooms) and upcycled hemp fiber, it is biodegradable and enriches the soil during decomposition. This unique product addresses environmental concerns associated with traditional burial practices by reducing waste, absorbing CO2, and enhancing biodiversity. The Living Coffin fosters a harmonious relationship between humans and nature, promoting sustainability and regenerative design. It has formed valuable partnerships with funeral homes in Europe, received recognition through several awards, and chosen by more than 500+ individuals seeking an eco-conscious final resting option. By using the Living Coffin, we leave a legacy of love for future generations, nurturing the Earth's fertility and promoting a greener, more sustainable world.

The programme is named The Language of Sustainability. The subtitle of the programme is When storytelling meets sustainable design. Description: In the face of climate collapse, designers must steer industries away from extractive usage models and guide users towards mindful lifestyles.

To truly glimpse the impact of design and make decisions accordingly, we must understand the product we design in context.

Storytelling is vital for unraveling links between ecology, sociopolitical systems and products.

Storytelling is key to how we approach the challenge to understand and communicate the entangled and interconnected nature of ecology with our sociopolitical systems and products.

Visual thinking is one of the many intuitive and inclusive languages we use to tell stories, reason at system-level, detect leverage points and, of course, design! It can make complexity approachable and depict different ways we can design towards a thriving and sustainable society.
 
As an essential part of our process, Accenture aims to devote this exhibition to visual storytelling. With this exposition, we explore and discuss the value of storytelling for the required sustainable transitions through the work of talented designers.

The programme is named German Design Graduates. The subtitle of the programme is We showcase the 25 best projects from Germany promoting the ecological, social and political responsibility of design.. Description: The exhibition shows how young designers actively contribute to the transformation towards a more compatible society for people and the environment.

Pushing boundaries and linking special fields

Designers are excellent facilitators for transformation. They have the ability to think their way into many special fields and to link these with adequate methods and processes and to let them flow into appropriate design solutions. These can be solutions for today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, close to the market, experimental or disruptive. We show most progressive circular, sustainable, socially compatible, in depth research and technologically innovative materials, processes and products from graduates recently graduating all over the country.

Discuss future topics

We discuss the significance of design today and in the future with and for the next generation of designers. Developed by our curator team we will discuss in accompanying discursive community events with the exhibiting graduates, designers from across Europe as well as experts from culture and industry in a series of talks about the significance of design in the context of Europe.

Curated by Amelie Klein and Jana Scholze

The projects were selected by the independant and international curators Jana scholze and Amelie Klein. Jana Scholze is design curator and Associate Professor at the Kingston School of Art in London heading the MA Curating Contemporary Design in partnership with the Design Museum. Amelie Klein works as an independent design curator, writer and critic. Most recently, she opened "Heimaten – An Exhibition and Survey" at Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg (MK&G) and co-curated the first iteration of the Design Campus School at the Kunstgewerbemuseum in Dresden dedicated to design and democracy.

The programme is named Ministerie van OCW x Ideate. The subtitle of the programme is Discover the land of the future teacher. Description: Have you ever thought about becoming a teacher? Discover the land of the future teacher and see how challenging, diverse, and flexible this profession is. This journey of discovery takes you through different areas that will stimulate you to reflect on your own qualities.

In search of the Teacher of the Future

Students in secondary education have an incomplete picture of what being a teacher entails. Both the study and the profession feel like too narrow a choice with few development opportunities. This while 91% of primary teachers are satisfied with their jobs, and 95% in secondary education. What opportunities are there to get more people excited about the profession?

To achieve this OCW and Ideate used a design-based approach in 2023 to develop behavioural interventions. In the project, OCW and Ideate engaged in mass co-creation with many partners, experts, students, teachers, mentors, deans, and school administrators. This is how we came to recommendations for campaigns and interventions that will help increase enrolment in teacher training programs, position the profession attractively, and enthuse students with a talent for teaching for the profession.

Step inside our installation, where our insights will take you on an inspiring journey of discovery - in search of the teacher of the future. Discover the challenges, the diversity, and the development paths within education. Might you be that future teacher?

About Ministerie van OCW x Ideate
This booth is a collaboration of the Ministry of OCW x Ideate.
The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science works towards a smart and creative Netherlands every day. Unfortunately, the teacher shortage is a growing problem that puts pressure on these ambitions. That is why the Ministry works together with schools, municipalities, and other parties. Ideate is a design agency working in the public domain. Together with our partners, we turn complex social issues into behavioural interventions.

The programme is named It giet oan!. The subtitle of the programme is It giet oan! Designer Rosalie Apituley and Alliander invite you to look at energy in relation to the weather and wonder: will we skate on summer ice?. Description: July 2030: The preparations for the ice season are in full swing. People degrease their ice skates collectively and keep close watch on the weather reports. Will there be enough sunshine this year? Will the energy peaks go through the roof again? Will there be an Eleven City Tour on summer ice?

When is there energy abundance and what do we do with it?

The existense of ice rinks in the Netherlands is called into question considered the high energy prices in winter. Besides the financial pressure, ice skating on artificial ice is has also become a moral question: what use of energy can we allow ourselves in times of climate change? If natural ice will be more and more rare in the Netherlands, how can we prevent the sport that everyone gets excited about, turns out into a collective “ice-sickness”?

Within the energysystem of the future we will dependent on the dynamic energysources of solar and wind. It is therefore important that we adapt our behaviour, rythms and rituals accordingly. Washing laundry at daytime, vacuum, charge the car. The network is increasingly bursting at the seams, because it cannot handle the abundant solar power at peak moments. What will we do with these power surges?

Will we skate on summer ice?

This project responds to the paradigm shift of our collective energy behaviour. We focus on the collective (Dutch) experience of the weather and initiate a celebration of summer energy abundance. We invite the public to practice counter intuitive thinking about our energy consumption, by skating on our ice rink. Will we be using energy when it’s there?

The programme is named Gendertaal. The subtitle of the programme is What kind of Genderdal would we want to see?
Plant Fictions presents the myth of Gendertaal at DDW23.. Description: Gendertaal transcends the proverbial: it is a way of being, a mythology, a re-telling of hybrid folklores. Hailing from different ethnicities, cultures and backgrounds, the merry band of storytellers reflect the melting pot that the city of Eindhoven is.

The diversity of colors and voices we are inspired by, in our neighborhood.

We invited responses from a range of individuals to chime their thoughts, on this thought provocation. The responses invite the literal, the speculative, consider the more-than-human. Gendertaal is more than the sum of the individual parts.

We pay tribute to the diversity of colors and voices we are inspired by, in our neighborhood of Genderdal. The numerous tongues spoken, languages, and stories we are enthralled with, and are familiar with. Gendertaal underscores the myriad of voices that one can find in a city. Art, design, film, food, architecture, gardens and community find common ground here— we invite you here with a curious mind - to partake in them, savor these myths and folklores told as they unfold in Gendertaal.

About Plant Fictions
As we stumble into plants, as plants stumble into being. Where these stories, curiously, find their way into existence, embedding us with the larger web of life. We select a few of these curious tales, breathing plant imaginaries into existence.

To sow, to seed, allowing for germination, waiting for harvest. We bring these imaginaries to life by listening, flowing with nature’s rhythms, being in a state of constant flux.

The programme is named Mahjouba Motor. The subtitle of the programme is Electric mobility supporting local artisans through a distributed and socially situated production system.. Description: Mahjouba Motor is an electric moped producer that supports the techniques, heritage, and relational working methods of Morocco's artisanat through a distributed production system for functional craft-made components.

Mahjouba Motor

Established in 2023, Mahjouba Motor acts as a meeting point for craftspeople and the electrical revolution. Working in partnership with artisanal producers and industrial manufacturers, Mahjouba Motor is building a sustainable social enterprise that can distribute work within craft networks while incorporating the benefits of machine made goods.

The collaborative model of the Mahjouba is focusing on the reanimation of craft through the making of creative connections between industrial design, the electric engine revolution, artisanship (20% of the active Moroccan workforce) and community development. The result is a decentralized socio-economic system that bridges the industrial approach and the local Moroccan made-to-order manufacturing and souk/distribution model.

Mahjouba 4

The Mahjouba 4, as a functional electric moped and living artwork, marks the final major development milestone on the road towards the Mahjouba 5; a consumer-ready vehicle which will go to market in 2024.

Over the past 7 years of development, each iteration of the Mahjouba moped has addressed a practical process in production through craft, design, and engineering, leading to the Mahjouba 4 which is the first in this range to be produced at scale. As the artwork transforms from ready-made to made-ready, it is freed from the orbit of the art market and subject to the conditions of industrial production and legislation.

At Dutch Design week, the Mahjouba Initiative will present components, objects, models, tools, and references from the past 7 years of development, focusing on how high and low tech, craft and industrial processes, and local and global value chains merge within the Mahjouba 4 electric moped.

About Mahjouba Initiative
Established by artist Eric Van Hove in 2016, the Mahjouba Initiative is an artistic platform that delves into functionality through the prism of art making. Born in the context of an ambitious renewable energy policy in Morocco, the project marks a new direction in Van Hove’s artistic pursuits, inaugurating a socially conscious and collaborative approach to creating art.

The programme is named Entanglement in Machine Learning. The subtitle of the programme is A installation to show the importance of fairness in AI models what makes you think…. Description: AI and machine learning model applied to the U.S. legal system. What could possibly go wrong? By highlighting the disadvantaged groups within the system, it raises questions about the ethical implications of using AI models in such sensitive and crucial aspects of our society.

Social Challenge

AI's pervasive impact on daily life, from education to finance, raises questions about its true capabilities and trustworthiness. At the core is Machine Learning (ML), enabling computers to learn from data.

However, commercial AI applications reveal biases, like gender and skin-type biases exposed by researchers like Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru. Amazon Prime's algorithm overlooked African-American neighborhoods, perpetuating inequalities.

Fair AI is vital, meaning systems shouldn't show prejudice based on traits. Biases often seep in during data collection and training.

Efforts, including ethical guidelines from organizations like Google, address these issues. Yet, public awareness remains essential. My design project aims to educate non-experts, fostering tech-savviness and mindfulness in AI interactions.

Unmasking COMPAS: Battling Bias in Justice

In the realm of criminal justice, COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) reveals a troubling truth—discrimination. COMPAS assesses the risk of an individual's return to crime, a vital factor for judges and parole boards. Yet, it's marred by bias.

Entering the criminal justice system means taking a COMPAS survey. This data feeds the COMPAS software, generating scores predicting "Recidivism Risk" and "Recidivism Risk of Violence." However, a study unearthed a disconcerting pattern: COMPAS shows higher false positives for African-Americans compared to Caucasians [10], perpetuating systemic injustice.

Our project leverages this revelation. ProPublica, a nonprofit watchdog, offers a comprehensive database of over 10,000 samples and a fairness analysis. As we navigate this intersection of technology and justice, our goal is clear—to spotlight these systemic issues, fostering a dialogue that advances fairness and equality.

The story of the installation

**Designing with Purpose:** Our journey combines determination and technology, weaving connections between tools, data, and users to create an engaging experience. At its core, our design aims to communicate essential insights extracted from a meticulous SHAP analysis, leveraging ProPublica's rich dataset. While the data is complex, we carefully curate the most relevant information.

On a global scale, we offer users a comprehensive perspective, emphasizing the model's accuracy, hovering at approximately 61%. This metric, though not a direct measure of fairness, speaks to the model's reliability in addressing significant societal issues.

Zooming in locally, users explore individual narratives, unveiling the specific attributes that shape labels and their relative influence. This provides a nuanced understanding of the intricate dynamics at play in the determination process.

In this journey of data, design, and interaction, our goal is to empower users with a profound grasp of information, fostering informed decisions and sparking meaningful conversations about fairness and technology's enduring impact on our society.

The participants involved in Entanglement in Machine Learning are: What A Beautiful Day to Cancel Somebody.

The programme is named What A Beautiful Day to Cancel Somebody. Description: Plush 'toys' inspired by both contemporary and historical forms of cancel culture. The soft and seemingly harmless toys convey a dual message, encouraging reflection on the implications of online call-out culture and the ways it is currently manifested through social media.

How it started

In 2021, I made a documentary about events that took place at my high school, realizing the truth years later. Seeking a conversation, I was only able
to meet with the principal who knew nothing about the story. Our discussion mainly revolved around evidence and facts, leading to some kind of a dead lock. I felt powerless, but later became determined to fight for my voice to be heard. Because a human-like conversation was not an option I devised a format for myself in which I could tell my story without accusing others; a documentary. Even though I felt vulnerable, I knew I had some kind of weapon in my hands. I wanted to remain reasonable, not come across as an overly emotional screamer and I didn’t want to cancel anyone either. It made me realize that making a documentary was a privileged position compared to others who express their voice through existing (social) media.

Medieval troubles

‘What a Beautiful Day to Cancel Somebody’ consists of a collection of stuffed toys that are inspired by both historical and contemporary instances of cancel culture. These cuddly creations are designed to critically examine the widely used red flag emoji, drawing comparison to medieval shame masks. The soft and seemingly harmless toys have a double edged message, reminding us that the red flag emoji is too small and general to simply cancel someone. The work encourages viewers to reflect on the implications of (online) cancel culture and the ways it is often expressed on social media.

History repeats

The idea for the plush toys originated from the fact that the red flag emoji has an innocent appearance compared to the harm it can cause. The plush toys have the same innocent and soft appearance on the outside, but they contain stones on the inside. These stones refer to medieval practices such as the public pillory and the shame masks, where the canceled person was pelted with stones. In the work, the boundary between two extremes is constantly pushed. Something as soft as a plush toy is combined with something as hard as stones. Additionally, the friendly internet imagery of emojis and memes is juxtaposed with dark medieval imagery. Multiple storylines and worlds intersect, provoking thought and contemplation.

The programme is named Cocoon. The subtitle of the programme is Cocoon is an experimental low-stimuli space.. Description: Cocoon is an experimental space, where you experience low-stimuli surrounding. It is designed to help you calm down your mind, which is often bared to overstimulation. It is a small, one-person capsule that uses natural elements to achieve its goals.

More:

In the spirit of synthetic design, I created a space that you can enter whenever you feel like you are exposed to too many stimuli, in which you can take a deep breath and just be. Your mind is being transferred into a different place using water elements.
It is because the water was proven to be enormously helpful in calming one’s nerves. It is called the Blue Health Phenomenon- the secret of happiness. Comfort and relaxation are the keys to this project.
This idea came from a place of extreme stress that I was experiencing, even burnout. By designing for an individual, I came to design for other people as well.

The programme is named Design for a Heavy Future. The subtitle of the programme is Post-Nuclear Design. Description: We unfortunately live in a time in which nuclear war is still a threat. Design for a heavy future exists of normal everyday objects redesigned in a way so they can still aid us during the events of nuclear war. Evoking open conversations while trying to solve an unsolvable problem.

Design For a Heavy Future is a series consisting of 3 objects that emerged from an investigation into the consequences of nuclear war. The reason for this research was the nuclear threat of Putin one year ago. Such a threat was unprecedented for my generation, and this caused quite a stir at the time. Today we still live with the same threat, although we seem to have almost become accustomed to it.

Continuing my research, I began adapting contemporary objects to help people prepare for nuclear war, with the aim of keeping our normal lives as normal as possible. An umbrella against the black rain, a pram for a walk through the park and a pop-up tent to take to festivals. All made of lead, so that we can continue to do what we are already doing.

The purpose of these cynical, non-functioning solutions is to generate an open conversation about these threats with a sense of dark humor.

The programme is named EGO DEATH. Description: A collaboration between Artificial and Human Emotional intelligence.

The project, “EGO DEATH”, explores the convergence of Machine Learning, design innovation and individual identity.

With the rapid growth and acceptance of digital environments in our daily lives, the digital space is quickly becoming an extension of both our public and private domains.

By bridging the gap between AI's (artificial intelligence) computational abilities and human emotional intelligence, this research aims to pave the way for more personalized, evocative, and meaningful digital environments.

In a world where the boundaries between the physical and digital are blurring, this project seeks to ensure that our hybridised digital spaces reflect our emotions and identities just as profoundly as the realm of our dreams.

The programme is named De Frontlinie. Description: By asking straightforward yes-or-no questions, an attempt is made to promote depolarization, shed new light on the recent protest actions in museums, and provide more insight into these issues.

The Frontline

Our society is polarizing. You're either for the soup throwers or against them. But is that standpoint really based on your true opinion? If, instead of shouting loudly, we were to ask ourselves a series of questions, we might appeal to our common sense. Would we still stand diametrically opposed to each other? This meters-long canvas helps us get closer and 'depolarize.' By questioning ourselves, we come to the conclusion that we're all in the same boat. And this boat, with art on board, is about to sink in a partially submerged Netherlands.

The Soup Throwers

Intrigued, I was drawn into the protests surrounding museums and activists who began hurling soup and other substances. The soup throwers stirred something within me as a creator because why did it touch me and so many others so deeply? In the 'Frontline' project, I aim to make you realize that we should all truly listen to these soup throwers and protect our beautiful Netherlands. Through simple yes-or-no questions, I seek to promote depolarization around recent museum protest actions and provide deeper insights into these issues. If we genuinely heed the soup throwers, we prevent art from truly disappearing. Then, a glass plate with a bit of soup isn't actually that bad.

The programme is named Shadow Dwellers. Description: With her ephemeral sculptures of speculative botanical species, Silke Riis plays with the idea of evolution pushed and shaped by climate change. By combining beauty and horror in the aesthetic of each piece, she reflects her own feelings about the uncertain future she is facing.

Materials and mortality

The sculptures in “Shadow Dwellers” are each at a different stage of a slow transformation. You might not notice it at first, but as you touch their tentacles or stroke their skin they might crack or shed, revealing how each piece is unmistakably in the process of decomposition.
Made with a self-developed technique, combining natural latex with unfired clay, each piece becomes flexible and resilient yet inherently ephemeral. Over time, the nature latex changes color, fades, and crumbles, while the clay disintegrates into dust or mud, exposing the structure within. These structures, or skeletons, most often consist of steel and ceramics, mimicking the fossilized remnants from past species in a speculative story of future life. Silke thinks of these artworks as bouquets of flowers, cherished for their fleeting beauty while serving as a haunting reminder of mortality.

With this installation she celebrates the act of adapting to hostile environments and the composure she personally found in envisioning a future she'll never live to experience.

About Silke Riis
Silke Riis is a Copenhagen-born sculptor and installation artist
whose practice revolves around speculative futures and imagined species.
She holds a Bachelor's in Fine Arts from The Royal Academy of Art, The Hague, and received The Stroom Young Talent Award for her graduation installation.

The programme is named On An Obsolescence Rescue. Description: On An Obsolescence Rescue explores ways to counter throw-away culture and repair discarded objects. By collaborating with Emmaüs Eindhoven, Théa worked on their waste stream and developed alternative methods. Starting at her own scale, this project stands as a step closer to a more circular system.

At the start of On An Obsolescence Rescue is a feeling of both empathy and responsibility for to-be-discarded objects. A couple of attempts were made to repair them and bring them back to their primary state, but only resulted in the confrontation to the impossible challenge of fixing a manufactured object without the tools nor the techniques of that industrial paradigm.

The junk was sourced from the waste containers of Emmaüs, where broken and unsold items are being discarded. Giving them a second chance allows to question the notion of efficiency and perfection, dictated by the industrial paradigm. This alternative production service embraces diversity and the particular in opposition to the pure and universal. This approach is perhaps less human-centric, as we adapt our expectations and needs to the materials at hand.

The process involves the act of collecting, categorising, analysing, and ‘repairing’. While exploring the adaptive abilities of the object, the object gets modified.
On An Obsolescence Rescue seeks to inform about alternative repair as an adaptation to individual needs rather than a strict restoration. The aim is to contribute to a shift away from mass production, towards a more circular economy and a greater appreciation for the discarded objects that surround us.

The programme is named Time flies but I fly higher. Description: Wall jewels, feminism, self-reflection, hidden layers and mirror of hidden identity, Felicie Vitrai explores your deeper relationship with your core and the role you want technology and your environment to play. She encourages you to interact with your own reflection and explore various avatar skins

New day, new skin

I'm fascinated by the concept of identity in our digital age. In this era, where the boundaries blur between science fiction, video games, reality, and myths, the question arises: who are you, and what image do you wish your avatar to embody?

Each day brings a fresh persona. During the past years, I learned to communicate in the online world, navigating between different identities. Creating different avatars, to anonymously experiment on every platform: a name for LinkedIn, another for dating apps, another for Instagram, another for Vrchat, steam, etc... It’s crazy to think how many identities you can take online, and how different they can be. You can control your own reflection, multiply it, and design it. When you leave your mortal body to enter other virtual bodies, your mirror reflection becomes simultaneously multiple and subjective.

Kaleidoscopic identity

This installation reveals the multiplicity of identity and its ever-changing mirror reflection, like a kaleidoscope. However, instead of immersing viewers in a virtual realm, I aspire to bring the virtual into reality. I want to make visible the invisible, engaging a broader audience, some of whom may not yet be acquainted with VR technology, thereby enabling them to confront the boundaries of corporeal materiality.

During DDW, I will encourage viewers to participate, allowing them to assume various avatar mirror reflections and become an integral part of my installation.

I am using different media such as 3D printing, 3D modeling, wallpaper design, painting, and mirror design.

About Felicie Vitrai
In my work, I try to dissolve the once-distinct boundary separating the digital realm from our tangible reality. I navigate between different techniques from wallpaper and painting, to 3D and VR always trying to create interactivity and engage the viewer in the installation.

The programme is named Alternative Openings. Description: In Alternative Openings, Gijsen takes a simple object, a lock. She uses this object to talk about one of the biggest social structures our world knows — ownership. In the format of a workshop, she teaches visitors how to alternatively open these spatial puzzles.

Housing activism

Being born and raised in Amsterdam, Gijsen feels a lot of connection with the city which has let her to become an active part in the activist community.
Through her years at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy, Gijsen discovered a way to use her activism as a fuel to tell a story that is deeply connected with the city and the changes it has gone through. In Alternative Openings (2023), she does this by taking a simple object, a lock. These objects of daily use are relatively small but represent one of the biggest social structures our world knows — ownership.

The workshop

In Gijsen’s Alternative Openings, she invites visitors to rethink the concept of ownership as we know it by understanding the technical side of locks.
In line with the essence of skill-sharing, she teaches visitors how to lock pick locks and lock boxes. By learning how to bypass the need of a key or code, you might see that property is just another illusion, like the idea of an unbreakable lock.
Up until the Amsterdam of the 70’s, people would let themselves into houses by pulling on a string that would come out of the mailbox, this phenomenon disappeared since then. Nowadays, the equivalent of that is a little box next to the door that opens with a code, and then presents you the key. Gijsen uses this story, amongst others, to show visitors different perspectives on the topic of changing social dynamics and the power of possession.

The space

The riso-printed manual Gijsen illustrated shows a recognizable relation to the space she created. The distinctive design language she developed over the years by making many prints and posters, forms a direct inspiration for the shape of the eventual workspace Gijsen designed for the workshop.
The table in the workshop consists of 149 ceramic tiles, each one is unique. Some tiles have an imprint which shows a technical drawing off the inside of a lock. The shelves cary the same element, with imprints of keys. This creates a tactile element that invites people to touch the objects and to have a seat at the table, follow the instructions and alternatively open these spatial puzzles.

The programme is named My Stone Collection. Description: The “Stone Collection” stands as a remarkable testament to the intertwining of nature, memory, and technology.

An unique collection inspired by nature

As kids, my brother and I always collected stones when hiking in the mountains in my grandparent’s hometown in Austria. It was always a competition who could find the biggest and coolest looking ones and take them home as a memory.

Nowadays, I question whether it is okay to take these stones from nature. Because for me, it doesn't feel right. Therefore I decided to use modern techniques to recreate the stones, instead of taking them from nature.

The stones are 3D-scanned and sculpted into functional pieces of art. By giving them a function, they obtain a tangible value instead of only the memory of that place and time, which has merely value to me.

The stones are 3D-printed from sand. I see sand as the offcut from nature’s sculpting and I bring it back into a shape where it could come from. The stones are preserved in a digital database and 3D-printed in a limited edition collection.

~The objects almost feel otherworldly. It is a memory from another place and time.~

The programme is named Lord of the Flies. The subtitle of the programme is Protector of our garden and all the small creatures that live there.. Description: Lord of the Flies, is the protector of the vegetable patch, an ode to gardening and friend of all insects and plant creatures. He takes care of enough rain in the garden, directs the ants and holds meetings with the worms to create harmony amongst the troops.

Ceramic sculpture

After working with ceramics for several years, I started a larger sculpture in 2017, the legs were finished in 2018 but then had a lonely existence in my studio for several years. In the summer of 2022 I was asked to create a visual work for the Pluk de Nacht film festival in Amsterdam. A good reason to finally finish the legs into a full sculpture. One of my favorite activities is gardening and I spend a lot of time in the Veluwe, by the forest where we have a small vegetable garden. Working in the garden is very relaxing and nothing is better than picking up some veggies from your garden and putting them directly on your sandwich. Also there is always enough to explore, birds, insects, sometimes a visit from a small hedgehog or owl. Thats how I became inspired to finish my sculpture, an ode to our garden and all the small creatures that live there.

The programme is named act of a line. Description: Act of a line is a serie of wall sculptures that function as serene yet captivating statement piece within an interior. The glass bead embroided bas reliefs stem directly from designs, created by hand in an automatic, intuitive process, merely referring to themselves.

'Swirls'

The 'swirls' are a series of unique but interrelated monochrome wall sculptures. They stem directly from Marijke De Cock’s drawings, created by hand in an automatic, intuitive process, merely referring to themselves. Or perhaps to the spirit of the moment they emerged from. After which, in close collaboration with a dedicated team of craftsmen in India, these drawings are transformed into tangible objects, adorned with a wealth of glass beads, and executed in either royal blue, black, gold, or iridescent oil black. The end result, provided with a cut-to-size wooden supporting frame, is typically the outcome of a single drawing. Or in some cases, it is the consequence of the thoughtful composition of several.

'Compositions'

the 'compositions' are artworks that depart from a variable number of automatic drawings, and then spontaneously and playfully connects them until they form an ensemble. Both the result’s composite forms and their motifs are then reinterpreted with needle, thread, and an endless amount of coloured glass beads, further defined by the contrast they create with the raw Belgian linen. Like the 'Swirls' series, their shapes are free from worldly references, but in this case allow for an abstract, yet narrative reading. They could be as much an ornamental part of a room as they are an escape from it, inviting you to visit their lustrous landscapes as a new reality, singular and unearthly, enchanting.

The programme is named Sacred Markings. The subtitle of the programme is Exploring our innate desire to leave a lasting imprint and the significance of
marking things as an expression of our humanity through objects.. Description: Exploring our innate desire to leave a lasting imprint and the significance of
marking things as an expression of our humanity, Jiin Yoon, Charlène
Dannancier and, Bominarae Oh reflect on how hand-drawn metal objects,
geometric elements and tattoo drawings become vessels for personal
narratives.

Tracing Threads of Human Expression

An immersive showcase invites you into a world of drawn atmospheres and an
intersection of metal drawing, tattooing, and visual storytelling.
The metal art furniture designer employs a unique technique, meticulously
crafting exquisite furniture pieces that become canvases for intricate
narratives. Every delicately etched line on the metal surface blurs the line
between the tangible and intangible, inviting viewers to explore the depths of
dreams, stories, and emotions.

Complementing these captivating furniture pieces are the artworks of a
talented tattooist. Through skillful tattooing, drawings come to life on the
objects, forging a mesmerizing fusion of ink and metal. This intricate interplay
creates a symbiotic relationship, elevating the aesthetic experience and
adding layers of meaning to the visual narrative.

To enhance the immersive atmosphere, carefully placed audio-visual
installations engage and transport visitors. These captivating experiences
serve as portals into the artists' imaginative realms, where haunting melodies
and mesmerizing visuals intertwine, blurring the boundaries of reality and
fiction.

The programme is named Conjunction Armchair. Description: In the beautifully curated space at the Central Station the 'Conjunction Armchair' will be presented among the work of other talented designers. The combination of the different pieces each with their own quality in both craftsmanship and aesthetics makes this setting truly 'Messmerizing'.

Interchangeable

The Conjunction Armchair is a comfortable seater build for the sake of quality craftsmanship. This resulted in a luxurious, yet playful chair that has both angular as soft shapes. The way the chair is constructed makes it easy to interchange the materials and make interesting new combinations in the future. It is also possible with this design to make it wider so it forms a 2-seater or even a spacious sofa.

Conquering Time

As a designer in the present day, it is obvious that you think about the sustainability of what you design. For Sjoerd Geerts, sustainability lies in the quality of production and design that does not rely on trends. The different parts of the chair are mechanically connected so that any part can be repaired or replaced if damaged. Or transformed if you simply want something different. You don't have to buy a new object right away, but you can play with what you have. It is also essential that objects are made properly. Something can be produced from sustainable or recycled material, but if it falls apart after a year, you can question its sustainability. A truly sustainable object is something that you cherish, and that conquers time through solidity in making and design that is not based on trends.

About Sjoerd Geerts
Multidisciplinary designer Sjoerd Geerts encourages the interaction between people, the spaces they inhabit, and the objects within by creating interactive experiences and unique objects for private and public settings. His work arises from thorough research and a multidimensional perspective.

The programme is named Laserglazed Lights. The subtitle of the programme is A collection of porcelain lights showcasing the distinctive interplay between light, a computer-controlled laser and ceramic glazes.. Description: The innovative technique 'Laserglazing' has been developed through experimental research that combines computer-controlled lasers with ceramic glazes. This method utilizes the unique interaction between glazes and the heat of a laser, resulting in extraordinary finishes.

A collaboration between Olivier van der Mark & Sanne Kaal

The collaboration between Sanne Kaal and Olivier van der Mark focuses on the interaction between light and Laserglazed porcelain. The light-transmissive nature of this very thinly casted material creates a remarkable canvas that is excellently suited to showcase the complexity and precision of the technique.

As the initial outcome of this research, they have created a collection of three lamps. Each of these pieces is handmade and uniquely influenced by this experimental technique.

The programme is named Beaver Dreams. The subtitle of the programme is Borrowing something from someone without their consent, accidentally breaking it and trying to repair it, hoping they won’t notice.. Description: In the work and my artistic identity I balance different aesthetics and actively avoid to pinpoint or categorize. Respectfully bringing something out of a context into my own, whilst creating a form language based on different interests and disregarding prevailing notions of function, medium/field.

The programme is named New Familiar Vessels. The subtitle of the programme is Curiosity Sets Things In Motion. Description: The vessels I created for Messmerizing are based conceptually on creating physical spaces in daily life to reflect on the unknown, drawing from nostalgia and the curiosity that surrounds something familiar but new.

About

The Hydra On The Lawn and Pool Party Vessels use imagery from my childhood, reimagined in the context of contemporary ceramics and combined with ancient mythology.

Their matte, textured and rocky forms are reminiscent of fossils, brightened with stylised colour choices. Created with the exhibition location of Eindhoven Station in mind and its activation through curious objects, I aim to spark a feeling of discovery or rediscovery in their forms.

About Elizabeth Lewis
Elizabeth is a Sydney based artist, working with practice- lead explorations of expanded ceramics.

She is interested in utilising materiality and the basis of vessel forms to examine how objects can reflect and contribute to a greater sense of wonder and connectedness with history.

The programme is named GLITCH. The subtitle of the programme is Central Saint Martins graduate collection 2023. Description: Gina Grünwald's graduate collection GLITCH aims to find beauty and freedom through limitation. It critiques our ongoing excess of consumption, using industrial waste to create six fashion looks. The element of rock climbing is central and omnipresent in textile design, construction and accessories.

Collection concept

Waste. There is so much of it in the world. Just look around. This collection is about reviving techniques of craftswomanship through repurposing waste and reused materials. There is an oddness to it — the young generations are trying to save the world, whilst the people in power are destroying it. GLITCH tries to find beauty and freedom through limitation. The limits we all feel — whether that is about saving the planet or finding freedom in ourselves.

Material research

Good clothing takes not only time but dedication, craft and research. If we want to change the way we consume, we need to change the way we see fashion. At the heart of Grünwald's collection stands extensive material research, with materials from excess climbing gear, fabric scraps from Swiss printing companies, and hand-made knits. Reexploring female craftswomanship through the lens of repurposing industrial waste is the motto. The element of rock climbing – a sport that brings Grünwald balance and peace while challenging bodily and mental strength – is central and references to it are omnipresent in textile design, construction details and accessories.

Footwear

In collaboration with SKUA Studio, a female led footwear duo in the Netherlands, Grünwald designed and produced six zero-waste heels for her graduate collection. Together they focused on constructing two completely upcycled shoe designs: using scraps of advertising mesh, retired climbing ropes and old climbing shoes. The magic lies in repurposing existing functionality of the waste materials collected — retaining velcro scraps to hold the foot in place or creating a standout lace-up feature with old ropes.

About Gina Grünwald
An antidote to fast fashion — Gina Grünwald is an upcoming Swiss designer and fashion design graduate from Central Saint Martins, based in London. She is the founder of zero-waste studio GINA GRNW, creating forward-thinking designs with an uncompromising ethical practice.

Description: At Messmerizing Douwe presents a large, unique collectible art object MIRAGE together with a small object in limited edition NEW HORIZON.

Simple and clearly designed sculptures

Douwe’s sculptures are formed simply and with clarity, playful shapes referring to the human figure.
In his objects he plays with the fundamental principles of sculpture such as space, shape and mass. This play does not stay as an abstract conception but always has a consequence in the meaning of his sculptures.

As a sculptor, Douwe takes a fresh look at tradition, but also enjoys making references to comics and cartoons. His fascination with the possibilities and limits of sculpture as a medium goes hand in hand with a form of humor, which widens perspectives of and lends lightness to his works.

His sculptures are created by hand in his studio in Rotterdam and are unique or in limited edition.
Douwe has done both private and public commissioned art projects and has exhibited extensively throughout the Netherlands.

NEW HORIZON

NEW HORIZON is a hand glazed ceramic object in limited edition measuring 25 x 10 x 39 cm.

MIRAGE

MIRAGE is a unique collectible art object measuring 110 x 65 x 165 cm. It is a touchable sculpture shaped by hand. Consisting of synthetic material and stainless steel.

The programme is named Amended 2.0. The subtitle of the programme is Waste not, want not.. Description: Amended 2.0 is the second collection of furniture pieces that seamlessly builds upon my project Amended in 2022. I continue the story of transforming polystyrene packaging and incorporating discarded aluminum fragments.

"Amended 2.0" is a continuation of unique furniture pieces made of used polystyrene packaging.

These pieces are more than just furniture – they represent both usefulness and the complexities of consumer culture. By sparking discussions about material we (re)use we are encouraged to consider what these decisions say about our value systems. The Amended series keeps pushing the boundaries of waste, urging us to rethink how we relate to materials, resources and the environment.

The programme is named Helios. The subtitle of the programme is “Helios”

a tribute to the eternal circle of light.. Description: Helios, an electric lamp, draws inspiration from ancient myths.

Crafted with a solid aluminum base and a hand-casted acrylic sphere, it encourages users to
adjust light intensity. Each hand-crafted casting results in shapes and patterns as unique and

unpredictable as the celestial realm.

“Helios” a tribute to the eternal circle of light.

Helios

In ancient times, Helios was revered as the god of the sun, entrusted with the responsibility of
guiding the sun on its daily journey across the sky. As he embarked upon an eternal voyage in
his majestic golden chariot, coursing through the heavens, his chariot painted the sky with a
mesmerizing palette of colorful and delicate hues. This breathtaking spectacle had the
remarkable power to transform the heavenly sky, casting a radiant and enchanting glow upon

the world below.

Drawing from ancient concepts, “Helios” pays homage to light’s circular dance. This design
invites interaction, allowing you to play with light’s intensity by moving the sphere. Just as
Helios shaped the sun’s path, you become the one who controls the brightness, creating a

captivating dance of light.

Description: Journey into the realm of the cardinal virtues, where captivating objects come to life in my unique artistic style. Each object tells a visual story, capturing the essence of these virtues and inviting contemplation.

Harmonious Aesthetics

Transporting oneself to a world where art and philosophy merge, igniting deep reflection on the virtues that shape our lives, is a poetic and inspiring idea. Such a world would likely be a haven for creative thinkers and seekers of profound wisdom.

The programme is named HIGHLIGHT OLEGI. Description: OLEGI is the next chapter in the HIGHLIGHT series: sculptural objects made of handwoven, textural textiles that play with colour, light and perspective. This imperfect material tells the story of a curiosity driven making process and an ever evolving interaction between maker and technique.

In a quick glance, a shifting, seemingly pixelated image strikes the eye. A glistening and bright object contorts its own silhouette. Watch from up close and discover a dynamic and high contrast surface in which bold and shimmering colours stand out against the soft structure made of cotton thread.

The OLEGI collection embodies the blown up version of the original HIGHLIGHT series through new forms with exaggerated shapes and stretched out proportions. With their plump body and bold and contrasting surface, the objects gain a creature-like appearance reminiscent of sea anemones on the ocean floor, where the lack of light and the movement of water distorts the view and morphs their silhouettes.

Crafts techniques and experiment

At the heart of the HIGHLIGHT series lies a passion for process, experiment and craft. The handweaving loom provides a framework and environment which can be easily controlled and modified. The HIGHLIGHT textiles are the result of a process of examining the loom’s limits and possibilities. Studying colour, contrast and light interaction, the textiles are carefully woven together in a rhythmic, manual process.

The woven textiles are then manipulated by hand, playing with pleats and perspective, emphasizing their visual effects. The OLEGI sculptures come together by carefully pinching the sheets of fabric, draping the textiles around a light structure of metal wiring. The vessel-like shapes create movement, depth and dimension. The sculptures reveal their imperfect surface and their handmade nature from up close, while from afar, a slightly morphing and glitching visual effect appears that can be reminiscent of a rendered image.

The programme is named Functionele Schoonheid Vormgegeven door Verbeelding. The subtitle of the programme is Visit my studio located at the back of the Sectie-C terrain and experience design that unites aesthetics and functionality.. Description: Step into my studio at the back of the Sectie-C terrain and acquaint yourself with a collection of designs that merge minimalist aesthetics with everyday functionality. As a product designer, my focus is on creating objects that are not only visually appealing but also practical.

Together, we share the journey from concept to reality, aligning with the theme 'Picture This.'

Welcome to 'Functional Beauty: Shaped by Imagination,' an enchanting exhibition hosted by Maarten Baptist Design Studio during the Dutch Design Week. Be inspired by my designs that embody a journey from concept to tangible utility, all within the theme of imagination and change.

Enter my studio at the rear of the Sectie-C terrain, where my designs hold not just visual allure but also represent a journey from idea to reality. As an autonomous product designer, I guide you along the path from imagination to tangible, functional creations.

As I prepare for Dutch Design Week, I proudly unveil the 'LEGG Chair' and other functional pieces. Crafted from ash and walnut, this chair tells the story of imagination translated into usable beauty. I share my process, from the initial sketch to the artisanal execution.

Explore my series of wall-mounted and freestanding cabinets, made from carefully shaped 3D aluminum tubes, and discover how imagination can lead to versatile design solutions."

The programme is named Portray Me. Description: In a world where visual cues often shape our initial perceptions, Portray Me creates a space that encourages unbiased connections by eliminating the reliance on visual and auditive cues.

Step into this interactive installation where voices weave portraits, and connections transcend looks.

Wired for Bias

Our brains are wired to categorize and make sense of the world around us, utilizing cognitive shortcuts to conserve energy and processing power. This natural tendency often leads to the formation of stereotypes, as our brains rely on preconceived markers such as facial attributes, features, and even vocal cues to quickly categorize individuals.

These markers can be influenced by individual beliefs and social norms, further perpetuating stereotypes and potentially leading to negative stereotyping of individuals as belonging to certain "groups" or "out-groups." Scientific evidence supports the notion that stereotypes are learned ways of categorizing people and groups, influenced by beliefs about the world that are acquired through various sources such as parents, the media, and primary caretakers. These learned beliefs shape our perceptions and can contribute to the perpetuation of biases and stereotypes.

Stereotypes can prevent us from seeing people as individuals with unique stories, experiences, and personalities. “Portray Me” aims to challenge and overcome these limitations, by eliminating the reliance on visual and auditive cues.

The experience

Portray me is an interactive installation where participants can engage without visual or auditive cues by using a text-to-voice app. During a 15-minute session, participants are given the opportunity to engage in an imaginative process while asking and answering questions. These questions have been carefully chosen to reveal personal interests, experiences, values, and character traits.

Participants are encouraged to create an imaginary portrait of the other person using the technique of collage, with materials that have been prepared in advance. This artistic activity allows participants to tap into their creativity, intuition, and perceptions, enabling them to form a unique representation of the individual they are conversing with. At the end, participants can share the collages if they wish. These collages become visual representations of the connections formed.

To encourage self-reflection, participants are provided with cards from an “oracle deck" that has been painted and designed by women artists from our community. These cards feature thought-provoking texts that encourage introspection and stimulate conversations around biases and stereotypes.

By combining the imaginative process of collage creation, the sharing of personal interpretations, and the use of oracle cards, our project aims to provide a multi-dimensional approach to fostering connections and challenging biases. Through these creative and introspective elements, participants are encouraged to embrace vulnerability, engage in self-reflection, and develop a heightened awareness of the unconscious biases, stereotypes and prejudices that may influence their interactions.

We hope to promote empathy, understanding, cultivate respect for diversity, and establish a foundation of mutual appreciation and support. Our ultimate goal is to create an inclusive society that celebrates the richness of each individual's story, and where connections transcend the limitations imposed by stereotypes and biases.

The programme is named Guilty Flavours. The subtitle of the programme is Harnessing microorganisms to re-engineering plastic waste for human consumption.. Description: “Guilty Flavours” features the first scoop of vanilla ice cream ever made from plastic waste. By harnessing digestion enzymes, this process proposes a radical possibility to eliminate plastic waste forever, emphasizing that true progress lies in the outcomes and our mindset.

Our ever-increasing mountain of plastic waste is an insurmountable problem.

Plastic production is not decreasing and the current system of recycling is failing to keep up. Guilty Flavours is a radical proposal for how humans can harness our own bodies to eliminate plastic forever – by eating it. New biochemical processes involving digestion enzymes and engineered bacteria could allow humans to safely consume plastic. Starting with vanilla flavour, this project explores how we can harness this process to create fully edible molecules transformed by living organisms.

The ice cream is displayed in a locked freeze as it needs to be tested for food safety.

This highlights the time-consuming and ethically-controversial nature of evaluating the plastic-derived ingredient: in fact, despite its chemical similarity to vanillin, whether natural or synthetic, the testing process is still lengthy as considered a completely new ingredient and a new technology. This underscores the urgency for finding innovative solutions and rapid change in our society and politics of the food system to address pressing environmental issues.Therefore, the ice cream will be locked and frozen until we, as humans, will make a decision on what to do with it. This is real and ready now, but are we?

The programme is named Secrid Talent Podium. The subtitle of the programme is Design as a force for good. Description: After a successful first edition in 2022, Secrid Talent Podium is back! At DDW23 Secrid shows the crucial role that design plays in our lives and in the transition to a sustainable future. This podium is part of a movement of designers who are opting to make better, instead of just more products.

From more to better

Look around you. Everything around you has been designed. From the pen that you’re writing with, to the phone cover in your pocket and the chair you’re sitting on. To market these products, designers make choices about the shape, materials, production process, and the life span of a product. All these decisions have consequences for our planet, and all the people that are involved in the production process. By making different choices, we want to shift the industry from producing more, to producing better. At Secrid we call this: ‘Industrial Evolution’.

About the Secrid Talent Podium

With the Secrid Talent Podium we want to inspire ever more sustainable forms of production and consumption. In collaboration with Dutch Design Foundation we select 7 talented designers every year who are using their creative power to build a more sustainable future. Their work is being shown in a collective exhibition at Dutch Design Week. In addition, each designer receives coaching and a cash prize of €7.777,77: a reference to our 7 design principles for sustainable product design. The following designers have been selected for the 2023 edition:

Claybens | Emy Bensdorp
Bricks that purify PFAS-polluted land

ClimaFibre | Jess Redgrave
Regenerative textile made from, coated and coloured with sunflowers

Fungi Force | Frans van Rooijen
Natural coloring based on biocoating

Solarix | Marloes van Heteren en Reiner Bosch

The programme is named The Product Chronicles. The subtitle of the programme is Exploring the narrative of things that matter. Description: Consumer society is running at full speed. The more we surround ourselves with products, the less value or meaning they seem to have to us. How can design today lead to products that will still matter tomorrow?

Meaningful relationships

The Product Chronicles explores how designers can address and strengthen the connection between user and product. How can design contribute to valuable products in the broadest sense of the word? And thus create a meaningful relationship between people and things?

The programme is named Absurdity in Making. The subtitle of the programme is Tickling Imagined Boundaries. Description: Absurdity in Making is a collective exploring absurdity as a means to challenge norms, bridging reality and imagination. Humans often draw imaginary boundaries across societal layers, influencing behaviors and shaping our world. We target the absurdity arising from the divisions these lines create.

A playful and absurd perspective on social imagined boundaries

Our research is about the "imaginary lines" that humans have always been projecting. In order to recognize the unknown and face uncertainty, people often create invisible boundaries for categorizing, labeling, and defining things. Although it brings social order, it also inevitably brings prejudices and social frameworks that wrongly lead people in a specific direction. The goal of Absurdity in Making is to liberate people's minds. Absurdity in Making provides playful and provocative perspectives on these imagined boundaries that are shaped in society. We strive not to eliminate these lines, but to find blurry areas of diversity and democracy. We oppose single values, aiming to foster dynamic dialogue from an absurd perspective. Those imagined boundaries spread across various fields in society, profoundly shaping the current world. Therefore, we want to link people from different areas conduct further research in the future, and share our ideas with the public.

About Absurdity in Making
In a utilitarian society, things are established under the framework of meaning or function. Those things that seem meaningless, contradictory, and illogical are absurd. We are a design collective valuing absurdity, using it to challenge norms and bridge reality with imagination. We seek to discard the functionalist mindset, opting instead to explore and draw inspiration from life's absurdities. For us, absurdity offers a fresh perspective on reality, prompting a re-evaluation of the status quo.

The programme is named Nothing Happens If Nothing Happens. The subtitle of the programme is Isola showcase at Dutch Design Week 2023: An inspiring journey through materials, circular and collectible design.. Description: In the Schellens Fabriek, a former factory space in Eindhoven’s city center, close to the well-known Van Abbemuseum, Isola takes over a 400 sqm space by showcasing innovative biomaterials, circular products, and collectible design pieces from its design communities designers.

Nothing Happens If Nothing Happens

Isola is gathering designers and design professionals with a joint mission: to go beyond mere sustainable design thinking and really make something happen. The founders call on all designers and studios to implement a concrete change in their modus operandi, bringing them closer to the concept of regeneration.

The collaboration continues between Isola’s creative director, Elif Resitoglu, design studio IAMMI, and Italian start-up ReMat, focused on mattress waste recycling, for the creation and design of the exhibition layout. The elements in recycled polyurethane, previously shaped for the Londonese set-up, will be reused and repurposed, raising the commitment to truly sustainable design. Different thematic areas will characterize the exhibition, from material research to collectible design and sustainable and circular products. Isola is pushing the level of sustainable exhibiting even further in its partnership with The Good Plastic Company, using their recycled plastic sheets for signage and in the setup where possible. Both collaborations make sure that less virgin and single-use materials are used.

The programme is named Ten thousand drops. Description: Ten Thousand Drops is a limited series of ceramic vases made with the dripping machine MOCA we developed. The machine drips liquid glaze at a certain rhythm, creating unique ceramics with a distinct visual language. Every piece showcases the combination of technology and craft with a natural touch.

The dripping technique

The project results from a continuous experiment with the dripping machine MOCA we developed. The machine drips liquid clay/glaze through an interchangeable nozzle with a specific diameter. The drops fall into a plaster mould or baked pieces placed on the platform which rotates and moves on a X-axis. Everything is controlled by Arduino.

Through the code we created, we can choose the speed and the movements of the platform, and therefore the ceramic outcome. Our machine is the link between crafts and industries: We can produce the same object at almost an industrial level, however, each piece is unique.

We will drip glazing on top of the vase to create a mathematical pattern: 10,000 drops. Playing with the computer code, we want to push the limit of the technique and see how many combinations we can make. The project “Ten thousand drops” raises questions regarding aspects such as production, automation, individuality, mass production, and the role of uniqueness in the creative process.

This exhibition will present the machine in operation along with videos to illustrate the process, allowing viewers to comprehend the intricacies of the methodology.

The programme is named DUO-TOON Project. The subtitle of the programme is SOLO en Samen op zoek naar nieuwe interieure vormen: een combinatie van ambacht en digitale ontwerp- en productietechniek met andere ontwerpers.. Description: Voor dit DUO-TOON project toon ik als zelfproducerend meubelontwerper orgineel en zelfstandig ontwikkelde meubelobjecten. En we presenteren in samenwerking gemaakte interieurobjecten. Het project toont de gevoelsmatig (intuïtief) berekende schoonheid vanuit materiele en technische mogelijkheden.

SOLO in beweging. Mijn ambitie is om functie en drama, soliditeit en speelsheid te combineren.

Als zelfproducerend meubelontwerper en beeldend kunstenaar creëer ik
vanuit de eigen studio en werkplaats meubelobjecten en specifieke plaatsgebonden interieurs.
Van schetsontwerp tot eindproduct: 'vrij werk' en 'werk in opdracht'.
Opdrachtverlening op maat met een persoonlijk samengesteld wensenpakket is mogelijk. Ook de opdrachtgebonden projecten zijn herkenbaar door een doorontwikkeld handschrift. Inspiratie haal ik uit de natuur en historie.
Belangrijke elementen zijn perspectief en plasticiteit.

Ik realiseer me te staan op de schouders van vele voorgangers.
Het Tjechisch Kubisme is me een grote inspiratiebron gebleken.
"Als het ontwerp zich richt naar de kunst wordt zij vanzelf nuttig", is een citaat van de Tjechische Kubist Pavel Janák uit 1910.
Het kubisme kende haar bloei in de jaren '10 van de 20ste eeuw met zijn veelkantige gelijktijdigheid van zichtbaar verscheidene zijvlakken. Ze opent de aanval op centraal-perspectivische orthogonaliteit en creëert beweging en interactie. Er ontstaat dynamiek tussen lege en gevulde ruimte, structuur komt in beweging en de kijker ervaart gelijktijdig verschillende gezichtspunten.

Permanent is er een voortgaand vormonderzoek.

NOVÝ SKOK, interieurobject. In samenwerking met BastiaanLuijk van Studio BL

De NOVÝ SKOK, een kleine driehoekige bijzettafel, is in samenwerking ontstaan op basis van een ontwerp van Frida van der Poel uit 1994. Voorheen genaamd SKOK.

Innovatief is de krachtige combinatie van digitale productietechniek en ambachtelijk vakmanschap.
De herkenbare driehoekige vorm, staand op drie poten, bestaat deels uit vernieuwd materiaal in combinatie met diverse houtsoorten.

We presenteren een tweetal vernieuwde uitvoeringen:
-met een nieuw 3D-geprint bovenvlak in het spiraal fyllotaxis patroon. Zeer sterk en duurzaam geproduceerd. In een mix van hernieuwbare grondstoffen zoals PLA (Polymelkzuur) en de houtstof liguine.
-met een nieuw 3D-geprinte knikvormige derde poot van transparant gekleurd gerecycled PET. Door de transparantie van het nieuwe materiaal ontstond de mogelijkheid om er verlichting in aan te brengen.
Daarmee is nu een kleinmeubel ontstaan als bijzettafel èn lichtobject.

About Frida van der Poel
Als zelfproducerend meubelontwerpster maak ik sculptuurachtige functionele meubelobjecten met een specifieke zelfontwikkelde vormentaal geïnspireerd op het Tjechisch Kubisme (rond 1910) welke tijd en perspectief, bewegelijkheid en speelsheid combineert. In 1985 startte ik als autodidact en in 1991 vervolgde ik mijn praktijk als gediplomeerde van het HMC te Amsterdam. Sinds 1990 ben ik als oprichter en deelnemer betrokken bij de nog immer florerende Vereniging voor Toegepaste kunst Galerie Zône..

The programme is named Shepherd curtains: 100% wool. The subtitle of the programme is Not just any curtains.. Description: The European market leader in sustainable curtains Royal Vriesco | A House of Happiness introduces curtains made of 100% wool. A natural and renewable material. A sneakpeak of our full Bio-based collection to be presented in January 2024.

Shepherd curtains 100% wool

At the DDW, we Royal Vriesco | A House of Happiness, present the development of 100% wool curtains. An innovation in sustainable window textiles. Wool is a naturally renewable resource and therefore contributes to reduced environmental impact. Besides being a naturally sustainable material, wool has many advantages as a raw material, such as being flame-retardant and insulating from the fibre. With its unique look, colours and textures, wool is perfect for creating an exceptional curtain.

The language of wool

The language of wool is unique. Wool embraces you and soothes its surroundings. You want to let wool pass through your hands. Wool brings tranquillity. Wool is unique as a raw material. The transformation into a curtain made of 100% wool is an innovative new application to integrate these warm elements into the interior.

Not just any curtains.

At Royal Vriesco | A House of Happiness, we never underestimate the power of a good curtain. We aim for quality, sustainability, and innovation. This innovative character is reflected, among other things, in the introduction of curtains made of 100% wool. As a natural material, it is naturally degradable and environmentally friendly. As the market leader in sustainable window textiles, this is where we take the next step. Not just any curtains.

About Royal Vriesco | A House of Happiness
Treating the earth kindly is also our responsibility. Sustainability is in our DNA! Within our capabilities, we contribute as much as possible to a liveable world. Working sustainably is our starting point; a prerequisite even. Consider our recycled curtain fabrics and environmentally friendly dyes. We control waste streams through reduction and reuse in, for example, our circular curtain fabrics. Royal Vriesco is Oeko-tex and Global Recycled Standard (GRS) certified.

The programme is named Light makes you see colour. The subtitle of the programme is Light creates colour, reflection and a sense of space. With the combination of craft & technique, the studio creates innovative lighting.. Description: During the DDW, the studio illuminates a former electricity house on the NRE terrain, with glass blown light installations. The studio designed and developed the shape of the light and the light element itself and are produced in the Netherlands.

Design with light

By working hands-on with a material in combination with light, they discover where and how to add light, so it can offers added value to complement each other. Light casts shadows and reflections, the exciting moment to steer and direct this to perfection, aesthetically and sustainably.

Over the year, the studio delivered various light projects and collaborated with glassblower Gert Bullee in the National Glass Museum of Leerdam. They researched the right shape, colour and finish. In addition, the studio has developed a LED spotlight, on which both the glass shape hangs and also direct the light through the formed glass. This creating special light projections which resemble cloudy skies, rippling water or morning dew creating a soothing, almost hypnotic effect. Craftsmanship and innovation literally merges together.

Yume Yume x Studio Thier & van Daalen

Next to their fascination for light, the studio shows a sustainable project with a Dutch shoe brand Yume Yume. A special edition has been developed of the well-known wall shelf from the series 'the plastic mine'. These unique plastic shelves are basically made from residual plastic or production waste from a Dutch factory where industrial semi-finished products are produced. The lumps cannot be reprocessed by the producer/factory, but for the studio it is a challenge to transform it and show the beauty of waste. In this project with Yume Yume, a limited edition of the wall shelf was made and Yume Yume matched their collection of limited slippers. It is a perfect match in terms of durability, design language and colour.

The programme is named Broccopork, Mushchicken and Peaf. The subtitle of the programme is Speculative design in the new age: TikTok is a new incubation for discussions of futures, where a good speculative designer is a popular TikToker. Description: This project explores how people will react to cultivated meat products in the future by introducing a set of fictional cultivated meat products via TikTok. The designed TikTok videos look at what debates, dialogues, and public discourse and context will happen and generate around lab-grown meat.

Background

The supermarket shelves are filled with plant-based meat. Cultivated meat is on the horizon. People describe the plant-based meat alternatives they eat on a spectrum polarised between plants and meat according to their similarity to meat. People share their plant-based food reviews everywhere and anytime at TikTok. These findings make me more curious about how people will react to cultivated meat products in the future. What debates and dialogues, and public discourse and context will happen around lab-grown meat? How does in-vitro biotech change people’s daily life and food culture?

To Make the Unreal Real & To Invite the Future to Now

To make the unreal real, I made up a fictional biotech company called “Plant+ Meat-” and developed its brand identity. I also designed some discursive props. There are delivery boxes and three fictional cultivated meat product props, Broccopork, Mushchicken and Peaf, including meat models and relevant product packages. To invite the future to now, I set up a TikTok account called Meaty Auntie and conducted a series of short videos to introduce three future hybrid meaty plants, as mentioned above, to the public to provoke discussion and dialogue about in-vitro meat and collect people’s feedback.

Why Broccopork, Mushchicken and Peaf?

Developed in consultation with cellular agriculture startup Hoxton Farms, the hybrid meaty plants is one potential category of cultivated meat products in the future, which is designed based on the plausibility of the current tissue engineering. Plants’ surface works as scaffolding, and meat tissue cells are grown along these structures. So customers can easily capture both the existence of meat and plants. The cognitive controversy and visual inconsistency stimulate the collision of different discussions and dialogues about meat, lab meat, plant-based meat and plants.



So far, the designed TikTok videos have gained nearly 3 million views and thousands of comments and followers.

Here is the link to my TikTok account and videos.

The programme is named SENSETOPIA. The subtitle of the programme is Sensory utopia or dystopia?. Description: Imagine a future where we are able to design our senses for our needs – sensing radio waves, UV light, air pollution, and sugar levels in our food. With technological developments like Artificial Intelligence and robotics, we might reach new sensory horizons.

The world is full of data that is not perceived

There are many known and unknown ways of communicating and transmitting information within different species of animals, bugs, birds, fish, plants, and any other organism. There are also many known and unknown sensors that receive specific information, like human soundwave sensors (our ears), bird geomagnetic field sensors (magnetite), or animal senses for seismic movement. The world is full of data that is not perceivable by other species.

What would you choose to sense?

As a sensory food designer, I find it fascinating how food brings together all of our accessible senses in the act of eating. But even with all the accessible tools, we are unable to detect the unhealthy ingredients in food. This curiosity about inaccessible data has inspired me to think in terms of perceiving the imperceptible.

If you could choose any new sense to enhance your daily food experiences, what would it be? What is something you are always watching out for in your food, or something you wish you could know? What would you like to effortlessly be able to sense?

About Laila Snevele
Sensory food designer Laila Snevele explores the perception food through multisensory research. What role does color, shape, texture, temperature, sound, mouthfeel and aroma play in our understanding of a certain food? And how can we use these elements to change or elevate our sense of taste? Snevele designs recipes for the brain.

Specialized in multisensory experiences for restaurants, brands, products and events, Laila helps you to share your story through all five senses.

The programme is named Spore Arcade. The subtitle of the programme is A take on Ruins and Regenerative landscapes. Description: Spore Arcade proposes a new take on decomposition and what we view as "waste" Many man-made structures dacay over time, and there's a lack of rationalization of this process: But what if we saw decay as a potential rather than a barrier?

A simple concept

Digitally and precisely-made designs, produced with natural and organic materials. This 3D-printed clay project reimagines how we deal with our surroundings and the potential of printed habitat for a more sustainable future.

It embodies the concept of blending artistry, functionality, and productivity through the realm of 3D printing with clay.

On display on this occasion we present a prototype of this imminent future: our team has meticulously crafted a unique creation: a 3D printed clay Mushroom holder, aimed at revolutionizing the way we perceive and engage with diverse species within our homes. By leveraging algorithmic design and coding techniques, we have materialized this innovative piece.

This allows us to design a piece that is controlled through a set of variables, but that can be infinatelly iterated creating each time a one-of a kind piece that is as vast and variated as the fungi it will hold.

The programme is named Performing Empathy. The subtitle of the programme is Using Theatre Techniques to Deepen Understanding. Description: Embark on a journey with DesignThinkers & playback theatre practitioners. Explore a design-performance synergy while creatively challenging the 'empathy' buzzword. Join an enlightening keynote followed by an immersive experience merging story theatre and Design Thinking. Interact, immerse, discover.

Discover the world of Playback Theatre in the context of Design Thinking and innovation

Discover the essence of empathy beyond the buzz. In the realm of creativity and innovation, the significance of empathy often fades as projects mature. To address this, we will showcase how alternate approaches rooted in theatre principles, including performative methods like Playback Theatre, hold potential to infuse Design Thinking with new life and depths of understanding. In this session, we will first present a key-note that intends to introduce the Playback Theatre method, followed by a practical experience that showcases the method. We will present why we feel that similar performative approaches to innovation hold huge potential to enhance empathy and support change.

Immersive Playback Theater Performance

Following our key-note introduction, you are invited to step into an immersive world where stories take a central stage. Experience a unique Playback Theatre performance where stories are creatively brought to life using physical and improvised theatrical techniques. Through the medium of performance, something truly special is born in the deepening connections that emerge out of our shared stories. Join us in a spacious, welcoming venue that sets the stage for a captivating journey.

Unveiling Empathy’s Impact

As the curtain falls, a new chapter unfolds. Witness the transformative potential of performance, as showcased with Playback Theatre, to generate empathy that helps shape perspectives and fosters meaningful connections. Engage in a reflective debrief, as we explore the experience of empathy and the impact on both storytellers and the audience. Where might these methods enhance current and conventional approaches and how might we begin to integrate and experiment with their potential? These insights ripple beyond, with the profound potential to enrich empathy across diverse design thinking contexts and practices.

The programme is named Het Kamertje. The subtitle of the programme is Een interactieve performance over regels en macht. Description: Het Kamertje is an interactive performance that takes place in (semi-) public space developed to make people reflect on the extent to which we reproduce existing power structures with our (unconscious) behaviour.

Maintaining the status quo

At regular intervals, the post-new normal is enforced in Het Ketelhuisplein. As a visitor, you will most likely come into contact with the enforcers of the post-new normal. Depending on how you respond to the enforcers, you may or may not be given access to Het Kamertje.

Het Kamertje is an ongoing investigation into power and (unwritten) rules. We humans tend to maintain the status quo, to uphold the prevailing norm. How do you deal with prevailing rules? And what do you do when you are allowed to make the rules yourself?

The programme is named outil.li. The subtitle of the programme is Responsibly develops and produces utilitarian but playful products.. Description: Through our designs, we seek new methods to create products within equitable systems of production and consumption. At Piet Hein Eek during DDW '23, we are unveiling our first product, lighting.

love for good design

outil.li emerges from 15+ years of industrial design experience. It is the tangible outcome of our personal quest for a renewed relationship with our daily objects. We came of age during industrial design’s heyday with Dieter Rams and Ettore Sottsass. Who were both responsible for products marked by honesty, playfulness and intrinsic quality. We are rediscovering these values in our current time. We take into account the contemporarily required broader understanding of a good product's impact over its entire lifecycle.

We are intrigued by the products we use everyday. And in how we, for these products of daily utility and joy, might progress towards systems that produce and consume with minimal negative impact. We base our work on 4 main principles.

our 4 main principles

The delight of a well designed object.
A product remains relevant, in our fleeting time, if it not only functions well but also provides joy. We aim to design products that bring pleasure in both experience and aesthetics. You’ll find this attention up to the smallest detail.

Responsible resources.
We aim to create objects that have as little as possible, or hopefully even no, negative impact on planet and society. Our materials are reused and reusable whenever feasible. Components are standard to eliminate unnecessary new developments. All products are designed to ease disassembly and reuse.

Modern production.
We design for digital production on a small scale. And apart from a few specialised components, we produce everything ourselves. 3D printing and laser cutting enable us to work precisely, locally, and at a scalable level. This minimises unnecessary waste and energy consumption.

Intrinsic quality.
Within the parameters of joy, responsibility, and limited impact, a small demarcated space remains for us to play. Here, we fuzz, noodle and nudge until it works and embodies the right qualities. We hope you recognise this joy in our product.

The programme is named Beetle Convicted After Spruce Found Dead. The subtitle of the programme is North Rhine-Westphalia - Defective judgement in case of the biggest biological loss of forest in Germany. Description: Germany witnesses the greatest biological loss of forests in history. It is said to be caused by the overpopulated bark beetle. However, climate change, planting of spruce monocultures, war reparations, political decisions and eventually human neglect and ignorance have all played a major part.

Spruce tree as commercial artefact

Visiting my grandparents close to Cologne, I was observing and capturing the forest catastrophe from a young age on. Over the years, the green landscape turned light brown. And today, it turned into kilometre-long spruce log piles. It is said to be caused by the overpopulated bark beetle. However, climate change, planting of spruce monocultures, war reparations, political decisions and eventually human neglect and ignorance have all played a major part. The forest was transformed into a factory with the tree being the product - a product prone to diseases and natural events, such as the bark beetle infestation. To give an idea of the scale, the commercialised spruce tree is by far the most used and thus the most important wood in Europe.

Spruce tree as political issue

The history falls decades back into the time after WW2, when Germany had to pay war reparations. Cologne is located in the west of Germany, which is a former British zone. The British cut down forests in the western part of Germany to cover their wood shortage, which the newspaper article header Mehr Holz für England (more wood for England) stresses. This falls back to the political agreements made at the Yalta Crimea Conference in 1945 by the "Big Three”.

Since Germany’s economy was down, fast revenues were needed. Growing fast and densely, the spruce tree seemed like a wooden saviour to grow Germany out of its misery. But because many men died in war or were still prisoners of war, women were pulled to the front to clean debris and reforest the robbed land stripes in geometrically arranged spruce monocultures, each with a distance of 75 cm, identical with the sculptural arrangement on the wall. Later on, the women were called culture or debris women and were acknowledged on a 50 pfennig coin, equivalent to their hourly rate, when the new currency in Germany was introduced in 1948. The two-step aluminium casts turn negative space positive and are evidence of today's condition.

Spruce tree as global seal

The three yellow protruding container seals on the wall with the signatures of the "Big Three" (Stalin, Roosevelt, Churchill) symbolise the decisions made on which the forest dieback is based. The heap of seals below them stands for the shipping of the beetle wood. Because around 80% of the spruce is packed in containers and sent for export. More than 50% of it goes to China, where it is processed and shipped back. The reason: the industrial effort to adapt the machines to the new mass of logs is too great. The ventilation tubes on the wooden pallet represent the commercialised tree trunk. The bark beetle trace under the pallet shows the prevalence as well as the utility of the wood, which is the essence of this catastrophe.

The programme is named Pavilion Encounter Iced Sound. The subtitle of the programme is Highlighting the climate crisis through spatial and sonic experience. Description: Pavilion Encounter Iced Sound is a pavilion with sound installation created by architecture practice rotative studio (Alexandra Sonnemans and Caterina Viguera) and composer Ramon Landolt.

Located at Ketelhuisplein, the project highlights the climate crisis through spatial and sonic experience.

The story of unseen and unheard fragile landscapes

​​Since 2019, composer Ramon Landolt has visited several Alpine glaciers. At the heart of this project lies sound from these different field recordings, taken on-site while listening to and interacting with glacier caves and seracs, crevasses, and glacial lakes, resulting in a unique sonic experience.

The Morteratsch-, Zinnal- and Rhône glacier have been visited both in summer and winter to perceive the changing sonic environment. Glacial caves are unpredictable entities because they appear during melting processes until winter freezes their current form, only to possibly disappear in spring again.

The pavilion as public room

The pavilion, designed by rotative studio (Alexandra Sonnemans and Caterina Viguera), provides an acoustic environment to the ‘music by and for glaciers’ by composer Ramon Landolt. The spatial expression of the pavilion reflects, and makes experienceable, that what we can not see, and in this case, hear: the story of unseen and unheard fragile landscapes, that are gradually, but also ever faster, changing, as a result of our own human actions, which has major consequences for our planet. The pavilion, with its subjective acoustical and visual voice, embodies this tension, as a sonic exploration of the climate crisis.

The modular wooden pavilion, connected by wood joints (wooden dowels and dado joints), has been designed as a ‘public room’, where everybody can approach the topic at their own pace, yet always in a simultaneity of urban and remote alpine sounds, like a glacier talking to the city.

(Encounter Iced Sound Pavilion has been displayed at the center of Zürich during the month of March 2023 and has received the support of Pro Helvetia, Swiss Arts Council.)

The programme is named Tête-à-Terra. Description: Tête-à-Terra is where nature's vastness meets human design. Created in collaboration with Mono Earth and Kale by combining unique soils of Cappadocia with waste fragments from ceramic production, in the form of earth bricks, to create a space for random encounters and moments of pause.

Purpose

Tête-à-Terra is a conversation stimulator, a space for random encounters and an opportunity for pause. Two gently undulating walls stand opposite each other, articulating an intimate space, whose purpose is realized in more depth when activated by visitors, becoming a place for meaningful human interactions and understanding amidst diverse perspectives.

Material & Method

Hands on production is the most humble and fragile form of contact with nature. The building blocks are produced by combining various soils with ceramic dust, an abundant industrial waste material. The earth brick is environment-friendly in terms of production and completely reusable.

The earth bricks are stacked to form two curved surfaces facing each other. By offering different vistas at each angle they play with the human eye, creating pleasant transitional moments and places.

Programming

Constantly surrounded by isolating distractions that push humans further into loneliness, this pavilion aims to guide visitors into a physical space to help them establish relationships and create simple and effective means for active listening. Paired with instructions on how to implement Troika Consulting methods, a peer wisdom exercise developed by Liberating Structures, the interactive components of Tête-à-Terra aim to create a space where everyone can feel grounded and supported and help one another understand the challenges they face while leveraging the collective knowledge of community to address them.

The programme is named attenzione. The subtitle of the programme is Dancing drinking glasses out of 100% recycling glass. Description: Drinking glasses dance around, turn on their axis, never stand straight, capture our attention. They draw the focus to the drink and promoting communication in a playful way.

Mouth blown in Sweden and made from 100% recycled glass - the emphasis lies on a sustainable production.

The usage of internal cullet

Glass is the perfect material for reuse. It can be endlessly remelted and created into something new. Therefore, we should be aware of what happens to this precious material.

In the process of blowing glass, defective pieces are a common byproduct, and cold working usually generates leftovers. This internal cullet should be recycled and reused. Unfortunately, due to the size and technical complexity of the remelting process, this is not always possible in smaller production, especially when there is a lot of broken glass of different colors.

The project attenzione creates a network of cooperation. Drawn from the idea of glassblower Peter Kuchinke the aim is to minimises waste in Småland. In this province in southern Sweden several glassworks have settled in the past and most of them still exist today. By taking advantage of the broken glass together and manufacturing new products out of it, we hope to make an important contribution to the environment. And it opens up a new perspective on glass production as well as on the product itself - an extraordinary drinking glass.

The colour of the drinking glasses refers as a relict to the artworks produced previously. Each batch has a unique color from soft light green to dark moss green, from lagoon green to midnight blue. There is no one and only colour, the product changes its appearance from time to time depending on the shades of other works. Hand in hand with the traces of craftsmanship, they are jewelleries for the table. Leftovers become something valuable again.

The programme is named Exploring the field of IN_. Description: IN_architecture encourages students to search for the limits of themselves and the boundaries of the discipline.

Designing for a changing world

In a world that is constantly changing, a designer must always be able to relate to new questions. Today is quickly becoming obsolete. The designer has to look for the boundaries of the familiar, as the unknown quickly presents itself. This new reality demands a different designer than before: working from an inquisitive and open attitude.

The ArtEZ Interior architecture courses take a critical look at the environment where design, craft, storytelling and research are always in response to the other or to a social issue. Much attention is paid to the relationship between body and space and to the responsibility of designers for our environment, inside or outside, large or small.

About IN_architecture | ArtEZ University of the Arts

The programme is named Beyond Disposal. The subtitle of the programme is The kick-off of a design project about household waste.. Description: F O R M is starting a multi-year lab-project on how we can better deal with household waste. The “Beyond Disposal” expo is about where design often starts: insight & inspiration. Instead of finding answers this phase of the project is about asking questions and exploring tangents.

Past

Before looking at how household waste is being disposed of today. It is interesting to look at how waste was handled in past times. History can provide context on why the things are how they are today.

Now

The relation between society and household waste today is complex and multifaceted. Understanding what household waste means today - in the broadest sense - is going to be essential for our design process.

Future

Without trying to solve anything yet - it can be very helpful to look at what developments are around the corner that could impact household waste in the future.

About F O R M designlab

The programme is named Over mening valt niet te twisten. The subtitle of the programme is By playing, you understand the other person's standpoint, opinion, and perspective on certain issues, and you strive for connection and understanding.. Description: Connection between people reduces polarization. Learning to listen to each other without judging, showing empathy for others, and being willing to let go of persuasion. This interactive game in public space creates an environment where open and respectful discussions can take place.

Beginning

This year, I completed my studies as a designer at the AKV St Joost Art Academy in 's-Hertogenbosch. Throughout my education, I've been passionate about societal matters, political differences, and groups within society that deserve more attention. My projects often center around addressing injustices, sparking discussions, raising awareness, and ultimately fostering positive change. This inspiration can stem from everyday events or more significant societal problems, questions, or themes.

I observed in my surroundings and beyond that our present-day society is seeking connection more than ever. However, polarization appears to be deepening its roots in our community. Whether it's political beliefs, religious perspectives, or social concerns, the gap between people is becoming larger and more intricate. This is a universally felt challenge, yet finding effective solutions remains elusive. In light of this, I chose to focus on bringing people together and combating the growing divide as the core foundation of my graduation project.

Design Concept

People often see polarization as something that happens only between groups with different interests or views, but the truth is, it mostly shows up in our everyday conversations. As a designer, my goal is to help people realize their own role in this and create awareness. By understanding the growing polarization, we can begin building connections and promoting open conversations and empathy.

My focus was on public spaces. So, in my design process, I wanted to involve the people who would be using it. I went out and talked to people, asking them about issues they face and listening to their needs. This gave me insights and helped me plan the next steps. The main focus of my research shifted to the missing interactions in public spaces. I found a solution in the well-known game of Twister. I replaced the colors with different topics that could spark polarization, like: social/capitalism, monoculture/diversity, or gender-neutral/man or woman.

Application

This game is mobile and can be set up in any public area. The topics are laser-cut into templates and applied to the ground using chalk spray. Over time, the game naturally fades due to both playing and weather. The game's rules are explained through text around the frame, capturing its core idea. As the game leader, your role is to spin the spinner and ask players a question starting with words like 'what,' 'where,' or 'which.' For instance: what matters to you, where does your frustration come from, or which things cause fear? Based on the question, players take a physical and symbolic 'stance' by standing on a topic. This initiates discussions about choices, with the goal of understanding each other's perspectives rather than convincing one another.

This game holds potential because the topics and subjects can be adjusted to suit specific groups. It can be placed in certain spots or neighborhoods for targeted enhancements.

The programme is named (Not) Jammed. Description: (Not) Jammed is an interactive installation by DuctTape Collective, part of Manifestations 23'. The work tries to break free from the notion of carefulness around technology and give an opportunity to the viewers to explore what can be done with a printer outside the constraints of its intended use.

Introducing Scott The Dot Matrix Printer

What if machines could think or experience emotions? Observing anachronistic machines has prompted us to wonder whether we truly comprehend these human creations. They often act out, get stubborn and defensive, take their time, or start wailing when you ask them to work. As a collective, our intention is to foster an appreciation for these machines and involve them in our design process and production by giving them the space to express their personality.

The work invites the visitor to engage with a dot matrix printer named Scott and in this way to actively participate in the production process behind printmaking. The installation facilitates a dialogue between people and a mischievous machine, in which the viewer is granted the role of a content provider, while the printer intervenes in the process of printing and acts as the layout designer.

Scott is listening...

The visitors of DDW can enter a “Scott’s Listening” zone, where they can talk directly to him, share a secret, read a poem or sing a song, where Scott will detect the speech and print out his own interpretation of it. Similar to how people sometimes misinterpret others' words or drift off during a conversation, Scott is not entirely precise. He cannot translate human input perfectly, mishears sentences and twists their original meaning. Further along he selects the font, size, leading and composition of the printed speech based on the pitch of his own distinctive printing sounds. The print result acts as a conversational timeline encapsulating the atmosphere of DDW.

The programme is named Network Applied Design Research. The subtitle of the programme is Design Research Conversations: Applied Design Research in Experimental Learning and Innovation Environments. Description: Network Applied Design Research (NADR) presents the latest insights about the dilemma's involved in deploying applied design research in living labs and similar experimental learning and innovation environments. How can designers navigate the challenges that they face during this process?

Design Dilemma's

Experimental learning and innovation environments such as living labs, fieldlabs and urban innovation labs, are increasingly used to connect multi-stakeholders in envisioning, creating, experimenting, learning, and trying out novel responses to diverse societal challenges. What is the unique contribution that applied design research(ers) may play and take in such learning environments? And how can we deliver on that promise? What are the challenges and dilemmas that designers may face in their contributions to these environments? During the session we will present and discuss how to navigate the following dilemmas: Open or Closed? Safe-zone or Real-life? Physical or Virtual? Transformation or Evolution? Fixed or Fluid roles? Discipline or Indiscipline? Present versus Future Realities?

The programme is named Environmental Amnesia. Description: This installation invites us to reflect on the complex relationship between technology and nature. It aims to bridge the gap between the planet we stand on and the virtual world we inhabit, all while investigating the underlying motivations for our longing to reconnect with nature.

Technobiophilia

The digital world keeps us from engaging fully with our environment, acting as a powerful tool for online connection and expanding our horizons. However, as our attention increasingly gravitates towards the digital realm, we risk distancing ourselves from the richness of our own living environment. In this context, it becomes crucial to explore how we can bridge the gap between the planet beneath our feet and the planet inside our machines, ensuring a sustainable future for the next generation.

Amidst this exploration, the installation focuses on the intricate details of nature, offering a unique perspective. Rather than showcasing an idealized portrayal of pristine landscapes, it delves into fragmented environments. By delving into the digital evolution of the nature, this installation invites us to reflect on the complex relationship between technology and nature, urging us to rethink our place in the world and the ways we interact with our surroundings.

The programme is named U don’t Know. The subtitle of the programme is Design Visions by UdK Berlin Graduates. Description: Seven Product Design graduates from the University of the Arts Berlin present their final projects in an exhibition entitled 'U don't know'.
Their diverse set of projects aim to tell new stories and to reveal topics that may have been unknown to you.

Revealing and mapping the Unknown

The world of tomorrow will be shaped by the thoughts and fantasies of today.

 Seven design graduates from the UdK Berlin, all have different backgrounds and different visions. What they have in common is curiosity and the drive to shape, to visualise and to feel their ideas. 'Not knowing yet’ has been their drive to research, discuss and create.

In their group exhibition they address issues of urban ecosystems, circular production, gender equality and new ways of living. ‘Sometimes design processes can be linear. But more often than not, you find interest in unexpected corners, change directions and move from the expected outcome to a new unknown.’

The UdK design graduates invite you to join their exploration of the future, mapping society, socio-political conditions, challenges and new design visions.

Open Frontiers of Thought

Did you know that you can print your own breast prosthesis, that the future is inflatable, that your smart home could soon be controlled through sculptural ceramic elements and that trees can talk to you?  

While the unknown fuels our curiosity and creativity, we are also deeply rooted in what we know, read and see. As creatives, rather than presenting the illusion of a perfect solution, 7 graduates from UdK Berlin aim to share their knowledge and findings as new approaches and visions. Maybe they know something you don't?

What you might get to know is what they have discovered in their processes and get a sense of how they see the world.

 What you will learn is their visions of different futures, seen through the different lenses through which each sees the present.

They cannot foresee all thoughts and ideas and next steps, not ours, not yours, but would love to see you at the exhibition, to share thoughts about the unknown and show the shape they have given it along the way.

About UdK Berlin Design Graduates
We are a creative collective of product design graduates from UdK Berlin. Our group exhibition focuses on research and design as a response to the challenges of the unknown. As we delve into a variety of topics, from new technical applications to proposals for human to non-human communication, we share an interest in the creative process and an education that has taught us to ask relevant questions about the future that we may not yet know the answers to.

The programme is named Bubble Trouble. The subtitle of the programme is An artistic playground in the former Campina freezer warehouse exploring the illusion of comfort and safety of our constructed realities. Description: With a selection of site-specific works and artistic interventions, Koelhuis Eindhoven opens its doors for the final time in its existing, raw state before renovation. Wander through a gigantic, inflatable structure, artificial scenery, and performances unfolding in the industrial heritage site.

Will the bubble burst?

“Bubble Trouble” takes the symbolic representation of the bubble—a space of comfort and a sterile environment—to reflect on our collective ability to isolate ourselves from social, economic, and ecological uncertainties. Bubbles reflect our desire for safety within our constructed realities. Yet once protective, they can have profound consequences. Think of the housing bubble's economic disparities, the social bubbles that segregate us, and processes outside our anthropocentric bubble that we have chosen to ignore.

The bubble also reminds us that when there is tension, its fragile membrane balances on the edge of rupture. When it bursts, some of them will create irreversible consequences, while others create a path toward more inclusive and sustainable communities.

Site-specific installations in the former Campina freezer warehouse

As Koelhuis Eindhoven transforms from the freezer warehouse into a cultural hub for immersive technologies, new media art, and contemporary culture, we reflect on both making and breaking the bubbles that define our own existence and role within them. Wander through site-specific installations, from gigantic inflatables to artificial scenery, and experience the balance between the comfort and fragility of our constructed bubbles that are about to burst.

About Koelhuis Eindhoven
Koelhuis Eindhoven is the cultural hub, focused on Immersive Experiences (IX) within the emerging Koelhuis District. The gigantic, industrial heritage building emerged from the redevelopment of the former Campina freezer warehouse. The venue will become an interdisciplinary center for new media art, immersive technologies, and contemporary culture. Its mission is to democratize arts and culture by using (digital) Immersive Experiences to make complex topics accessible to a wide audience.

The programme is named Possession to Nature. Description: This project has been started from questions about a territorial dispute over "the island".

What does it mean to possess? We try to own nature and fight over it through money, borders, boundaries, and maps in the language we have defined. But from nature's perspective, such language does not exist.

Meaning of ...

The questions invite us into a space for exploring the meaning and time of our behavior towards nature today.

In a space filled with salt representing the earth as a landscape, the audience is invited to touch it with their bodies and hands, creating their own spaces and boundaries. On the last day of the exhibition, a performance of pouring water and washing away our traces raises questions about the meaning of our behaviors.

This question from one island extends to all the territorial conflicts that are happening around the world today. Also, it asks us to reflect on our current state of communication with nature and how we need to be in a symbiotic relationship with it in the future.

The programme is named Soil Symphony. Description: Environmental artist Theo Rekelhof created a kinetic art installation called ‘Soil Symphony’. Through the metaphor of broken records stuck on repeat, he lays bare the absurdity of monoculture and its damaging effects on our soil. Evoking in us a desire for biodiversity and harmonious variation.

Monoculture

Almost one-third of the world’s farmable land has disappeared in the last four decades. All of the world’s topsoil could become unproductive within 60 years if current rates of loss continue. (UN)

One of the main drivers of soil degradation are unsustainable farming practices. Soil health is often neglected, as the focus is primarily on rapid and intensive plant growth — the end "product."
This is especially seen in the agricultural method of mono-cropping, where one kind of crop is grown on the same farmland year after year without change. It reduces the potential of the land to nourish a wide range of plant species. With each repetition cycle it reduces the nutrients available for plants to grow, creating a vicious cycle of decline in soil health, turning fertile land into a barren desert.

The repetition of broken records.

Inspired by the workings of soil health, the Environmental artist Theo Rekelhof combined his passion for nature and love for music into a vibrant art installation called "Soil Symphony". Through the metaphor of broken records stuck on repeat, he lays bare the absurdity of monoculture and its damaging effects on our soil.

A scratch in the record impedes the needle's movement, limiting its play to a mere fraction of the record's potential. Instead of a full range of songs, it's now stuck in a monotonous repetition of just a few isolated seconds. With each passing moment, the scratch deepens, gradually turning what music remains into noise.

Theo Rekelhof aims to evoke in the viewer a desire to see the records of soil symphony free from repetition. He hopes this desire extends to appreciating diversity in both agriculture and life as a whole. He believes that diversity is necessary as it is beautiful, be it in ecology, people, or music.

The programme is named Tools & Crafts. The subtitle of the programme is As a tribute to the rich Dutch tradition of craftsmanship, Isola collaborates with a local woodworker to host the exhibition Tools & Crafts.. Description: The show focuses on a new generation of artisans who combine traditional expertise with innovative and experimental techniques to create contemporary and collectible design pieces. Visitors can engage with the designers as they show the versatility of modern tools and techniques.

Tools & Crafts

From applying coding and 3D printing to glassblowing, casting, and molding techniques, the projects involved will show how design can cherish tradition and honor ancient and new techniques while fostering innovation.

The setup of Tools & Crafts will be developed in partnership with Eindhoven-based designer Pepijn Fabius Clovis, known for his hands-on approach. Next to the entrance of the exhibition space, he will recreate a janitor's office. On a stage with a workstation, part of the exhibition design conceived by Pepijn Fabius Clovis and one of Isola’s curators, Wisse Trooster, designers will have the opportunity to show their skills and craftsmanship to the visitors during live demonstrations. The exhibition stages and displays will be painted with plant-based paint provided by Fairf.

In addition to Isola’s exhibition, three other crafts-related shows by Social Label, woodworker Jan Gerritsen, and The Visionary Lab will animate Fuutlaan 12c.

The programme is named Bioluminescence. The subtitle of the programme is Plant-Based Lighting Concepts. Description: The Wasatch Design Collective is focused on solving problems through folding. We have designed a series of fold-it-yourself lamps made from bioplastics. By creating products in this way, we have reduced the amount of petroleum used in the manufacture and shipping of our production.

Folded Forms

Folding can be a way of simplifying production, reducing waste, and making something beautiful and engaging. Our collective core values include consuming responsibly while actively taking part in forming the things around us. We have designed several pendant and table-top lamps, made from bioplastics, that arrive flat and are folded into form by the end user. Visitors to our exhibit will see our work up close, both in flat and folded form.

About Wasatch Design Collective
We are a collective of industrial designers who experiment with folding as a problem solving and morphogenic strategy. We use origami principles and methods to create low-waste, efficient products that invite user interaction and delight. Our non-paper folded works range from furniture to food to a folding ballistic barrier. Over the past ten years, our collective has shown products in many local and international exhibitions.

The programme is named Fleur Peters, Iris Lucia, Emma Hoogstede. The subtitle of the programme is Colorful interior objects. Description: We are Studio Fleur Peters, Iris Lucia Design and Emma Hoogstede. Three individual makers with a shared interest in exploring the bounderies of delicate materials like glass, thin 3D printed plastic and ceramics. We present our 3 collections of colorful interior objects together at Piet Hein Eek.

Exploring material bounderies

Fleur Peters is fascinated by light and color, which translates into her work with glass, where she examines the relationship between craftsmanship and contemporary design.
The sun is her greatest source of inspiration. With her designs, she makes sunlight visible. The reflections, refractions, shadows, and colors of the glass play with the light and give depth to her designs.

All objects from Iris Lucia Design are 3D drawn with lines consisting of bio-resin.
Everyday objects like a vase or a teapot are sketched with a pen in space. A futuristic craft where each piece is unique. The desired object is immediately given volume.
It literally explores the boundaries of form, between the lines. Raising fundamental questions: How much material do we need? How lightly can we live?

Emma’s colorful ceramic interior objects have a flexible function and their ambiguous character invites play.
The designs arise from an ongoing research into the bounderies of clay itself and the moulds used to cast and form that clay. 
Her goal is to create a bond between the user and the object in the hope to extend the life-span of that object. And just as important: add some fun to your day!

The programme is named Dialogues of the Unheard. The subtitle of the programme is Stories that matter. Description: Design has the potential to serve narratives that have been underrepresented. We design to cultivate greater awareness. The works by six visionary young designers are crafted with this precise purpose in mind: to amplify and bring to the forefront those dialogues that have long remained unheard.

Listen closely, look closer

The show highlights stories that are often not listened to. The projects focus on underrepresented and overlooked stories, engaging in a dialogue with each other and the visitors.

Coming together

“Dialogues of the Unheard" is a collective exhibition featuring a group of recently graduated designers from Design Academy Eindhoven. The group is diverse in cultural backgrounds and practices, what brings them together is the urge to speak up for the overlooked and unheard.

Six Perspectives, Many Media

Different media converge to amplify these ideas and ensure they are heard. Installations ranging in format from furniture to video draw attention to the topical choir. Each work for itself makes another topic tangible.

The programme is named Koraal | een jubileumset. The subtitle of the programme is 30 years Mariëtte Wolbert Textiles | an anniversary edition. Description: During the DDW, Mariëtte Wolbert wants to show her own label in quirky kitchen textiles that she has started since 2014. In addition, special attention is paid to her anniversary set Koraal because of her 30 years of designing kitchen textiles.

Koraal | Inspiration

When Mariëtte Wolbert started her career as a textile designer 30 years ago, she was snorkeling in the Red Sea and was enchanted by the colors and the fairy-tale world of coral. Thanks to a recent TV item about 'Burgers Zoo Ocean', she suddenly saw clearly that this wonderful world but also the impending demise had to be the subject of her special anniversary edition.

Coral is actually a group of animals. In the agglomeration of the coral live unicellular algae that give the colour to the coral. All types of coral are protected and now have a very hard time in nature: mainly due to climate change, but also due to pollution and overfishing.

In the design of the anniversary kitchen set Coral, Mariëtte used the fan shape of the 'acabaria splendens', a soft coral species. The circles in the canvases are the larvae that swirl to find a place further down. In the edge she has applied the 'brain coral'.

Glasses towel

In addition to the anniversary kitchen set, Mariëtte designed a half-linen glass cloth that was developed in collaboration with the Weaving Museum Geldrop. She first researched the possibilities in the museum. There were some limiting factors but it was also very inspiring. A visit to museum Bussemakershuis, a museum about the Twente textile industry with great knowledge of linen, led to an adjustment in the binding she had originally conceived.

The warp threads of the glasses towel consist of strips of blue and red cotton. This symbolizes the coral and algae that live next to each other and thus get each other's colour. Due to climate change, the coral is fading. This is symbolized by more spaces between the stripes and also a colour change in the stripes. The blue becomes light blue and the red becomes pink. The weft is made of sand-colored linen. Halfway through, it turns into white. Here, too, you can see the symbolism of the fading

Studio BL, inspired by the Coral tea towel, has developed a 3D printed coral button exclusively for Mariëtte Wolbert Textiles to hang up the towels.

This research was made possible by Stimuleringsfonds Creatieve Industrie

The programme is named Lichtspiel. The subtitle of the programme is Experiment Nr. 2 – Underworld. Description: Zalán Szakács invites the audience to descend into the basement of Koelhuis Eindhoven for an embodied experience that sits between mysticism and technology. Lichtspiel interweaves narratives of the past and the present through an interplay between light, haze, and sound.

History of light

Zalán Szakács is an artist who brings together immersive art, scenography, and research into historical media. For his project Lichtspiel he conducted a media archaeological investigation into the perceptual qualities of projection techniques from the 17th century. During this shifting period between the mystical time of alchemy and the scientific inventions of the Enlightenment, machines and instruments were not only seen as functional and technical objects but also carried metaphorical narratives.

Lichtspiel at Koelhuis Eindhoven

Szakács’ site-specific version of Lichtspiel engages with the water-flooded basement of Koelhuis Eindhoven through light, haze, and sound. Lichtspiel interprets unrealised machine drawings from four centuries ago through contemporary technologies. Inspired by the writings of the Jesuit scholar Athanasius Kircher, Szakács guides the public through the shifting environment of the underworld. They become part of the work as their shadows form on the walls while they move through the space. By combining various kaleidoscopic lenses with a kinetic motor, the spectators find themselves in a configuration of mysticism and technology.

The programme is named (A)I Designed a Chair. The subtitle of the programme is “Embodying the symbiosis of human and AI”. Description: How can AI be used in a creative process? In an era of rapid technological evolution, I explored the opportunities of Generative AI in design. While some view AI as a potential threat, I embraced AI as a creative partner to create unique designs, which marks a new chapter in our approach to design.

AI-Augmented Design

Guided by the fundamental principle: “human and machine," I delved into AI's potential in my design process through an approach called AI-Augmented Design. This pioneering methodology not only expedites the creation of designs but also redefines the very standards of design innovation. My creative journey led me to craft a manifesto that demystifies AI's role in design, making it accessible to all. This manifesto serves as a beacon, shedding light on diverse perspectives that illuminate AI as a collaborative partner rather than a mere tool.

The genesis of 500 chairs

Guided by the manifesto as my guiding principle, I embarked on a process of integrating Generative AI into my design approach. By integrating craftsmanship with AI's generative capabilities, AI produced 500 chair designs, from which I brought one, the U-Chair, to life. This unique journey revealed the intricate nature of AI-generated ideas, resulting in a design that went beyond what I could have imagined. The U-Chair, with its unconventional twin backrests and three legs, showcases the adventurous creativity of Generative AI. This design exemplifies the limitless potential AI can unlock.

This project is about more than just a unique chair. It brings a new and groundbreaking way of looking at how AI can be used in design, which also starts conversations about using AI in design.

Step into the future; explore the limitless potential of AI-Augmented Design.

The programme is named Spiritus Ludi - Spirit of the Game in Esports. The subtitle of the programme is Smart sleeves foster social connection between e-sport players when gaming remotely.. Description: The two smart sleeve products enhance social connection of remote e-sport teams. Spiritus Ludi energises players using “digital high-fives”, while Ripple promotes calmness with synchronised breathing in a team using gentle touch. The development is done at Häme University of Applied Sciences.

What if we could share digital high fives within a remote team?

Spiritus Ludi is a smart sleeve for sharing encouraging touches in remote e-sport teams.

The best performing sports teams express more social touch gestures such as high fives, fist bumps, and taps than lower performing teams. In e-sports, even on a professional level, teams train and compete far from each other. Spiritus Ludi enables touch gestures in remote e-sport teams. It is a smart sleeve which sends and receives touches in real time. When a player taps the sleeve, it sends a touch message to all team members’ sleeves. The sleeve is connected to a mobile app which takes care of the touch communication between the players. Spiritus Ludi has been tested with several e-sport teams. It elevates connection and promotes positive emotions between players.

The parts of the product: Smart sleeves with flexible electronics, mobile app with wireless communication, and cloud service.

Imagine if we could enhance our team spirit by synchronising our breathing.

Ripple is a smart sleeve which guides an e-sport team to synchronous calm breathing by touch.

E-sports players often experience high stress levels, nervousness, anxiety, and excitement prior and during a match. These have a negative impact on team spirit and performance. Ripple is a smart short sleeve which assists using touch to calm breathing in a team. The sleeve gently strokes the arm of the player when it is turned on prior to or during the breaks of a game by the coach. When Ripple is on, the team breaths along with the stroking movement in a synchronous rhythm. This reduces stress levels, promotes a stronger connection between players, and improves co-operation and performance.

The parts of the product: Smart sleeves with flexible electronics, mobile app with wireless communication, and cloud service.

The programme is named Internet Explorer. The subtitle of the programme is By climbing a digital mountain, the internet user tries to find satisfaction in the digital realm.. Description: Graphic designer Jurre Latour invites you on a digital hike up the mountain. By joining his digital expedition, the question is whether it is possible to find a sort of satisfaction within the digital realm, comparable to a 'true experience'.

About ‘Internet Explorer’

A computer chair in front of multiple screens playing a video of a digital hike up the mountain. (00:20:36)

The screens around us are just a fraction of the technology we use every day. They provide solutions for things that weren't a problem before. It made our lives much easier. We are looking for ways to do things with as little effort as possible. Comfortable and efficient, but without feeling fulfilled afterwards.

By digitally climbing up a mountain, the internet user tries to find satisfaction in the digital realm. While using little effort, he tries to recreate the experience of the highly straining activity that is mountain climbing.

The search for digital satisfaction

Technology seems like the obvious solution for most of our daily problems, such as communication, entertainment and obtaining information. But do we have a solution for bigger, more important questions? Questions like; ‘How will we find satisfaction in life?’ Now that we developed the habit of finding solutions in technology, the obvious answer will be; with technology.

The efficiency of technology is something that usually works in everyone's favor. But it cuts out a lot of factors that might add to the journey. When I myself was stuck in my digital habits while graduating, I decided to go and hike a mountain in Austria. With the intention of clearing my head and detoxing from my daily dose of technology I became aware of the smaller things around me. The complexity and serendipities along the way gave me joy. I started wondering if there is a way to integrate that joy I felt there in my digital habits at home. So I wondered if climbing that same mountain digitally, could recreate the feeling I experienced there.

The programme is named MAINFRAME: Living Technology. The subtitle of the programme is MAINFRAME is the heart to our heartless digital infrastructure, enabling these systems to better empathize with our collective emotional well-being.. Description: Designed by Synthetic State, MAINFRAME is a next-generation processor powering emotive technologies, intending to bring life to our lifeless systems.

Integrated within an installation consisting of dynamic lighting, sound and movement, users can interact and connect emotionally.

MAINFRAME Technology

Compared to our digital technology, all based on rigid 1’s and 0’s, MAINFRAME instead flows freely like a wave. As a result, at a deeply fundamental level MAINFRAME is better suited for functions which require a more dynamic and living feel.

Currently in prototype, once fully developed it will be integrated into our cold and lifeless digital systems, acting as the emotional core to this otherwise logical technology. While these existing systems only allow interaction through clicks and swipes, with MAINFRAME they can empathize with users closely.

We need to urgently surround ourselves with living systems which can properly adapt to the collective emotional trends in society. Otherwise current issues such as viral panic, virtual tribalism and algorithmic inequality will only multiply.

Installation

A swarm of networked MAINFRAME processors are integrated into the installation, acting as the heart within a geometric structure representing the rigidity of our digital systems.

Using light, sound and movement, it expresses its emotional core to anyone nearby. Through sensors, users can interact freely without technical discrimination; allowing anyone to form a relationship and experience the playfulness of this technology.

The programme is named House of Dreams. The subtitle of the programme is Take a nap and disconnect. Description: With House of Dreams we explore the bedroom of the future. We offer a bedstead made of only responsible and locally harvested materials, a safe place to close your eyes, take a nap, refresh your mind and dream a dream that stays your own.

Cherish your Dreams

Where we sleep, when we sleep and how long we sleep has changed throughout history. Our current sleeping pattern dates back to the 19th century, when the introduction of artificial light changed the sleeping landscape. After all, this meant that sunset no longer marked the end of our social and/or work activities.
Currently, we are at the dawn of a new era; the AI era.
We think this development will really impact our bedrooms and change the way we sleep.
We have already seen digital devices making their appearance in the bedroom. We scroll through our phones, watch something on television or read an article on our tablets before closing our eyes to go to sleep. But it doesn't stop here.
With the rapid development of AI and EEG, in a few years we will be able to control our phones, electric cars or laptops using only our thoughts. It is long past strange to think that not only our thoughts will be recorded, but even our dreams.
The question we ask ourselves with House of Dreams is, is this what we want?

The programme is named At Spirit Level. The subtitle of the programme is This solo exhibition by Bas van Raay invites a digital-life escape, while rediscovering your inner self.. Description: COVA Art Gallery proudly presents 'At Spirit Level', an exhibition by Bas van Raay that offers a break from our digital lives and encourages you to reconnect with your inner self. Amidst the noise of algorithms and online connections, At Spirit Level offers a unique chance for reflection.

From tools to art objects

Industrially crafted spirit levels, assembled deliberately, invite you to look more closely, creating a moment of introspection. The journey unfolds with a new narrative—a process that starts with form studies. Sketches spring to life, wooden blocks are being stacked, and spirit levels are gathered for experimentation. A blend of form and function is maintained; while retaining its spirit level utility, the tools smoothly transforms into wall art.

Each object, a testimony to this devotion, seeks to resonate with its beholder. Forged within a personal workshop, the artist's ‘sanctuary’, every piece is nurtured into existence.

In balance

More than an exhibition, 'At Spirit Level' initiates a dialogue between your spirit and the tangible world. In an era dominated by fleeting interactions, it's a reminder that true satisfaction arises from deep connections—with others and with your own essence. The precision of these spirit levels mirrors the need for balance in our inner lives, urging us to reconsider our priorities.

At Spirit Level’ extends an open invitation to partake in a journey that values authenticity, introspection and true connections in a world longing for depth.

The programme is named Antifragile Ceramics. The subtitle of the programme is ‘Antifragile Ceramics’ is part of the exhibition ‘Something Fragile’ in the former brewery of the Schellens Factory.. Description: The inspiration for the pieces on show came from the word Antifragile.

Author Nassim Taleb defines the term this way: Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty.

We must adapt to the ever changing kaleidoscope that is our reality.

In both art and design it is often if not always necessary to have an antifragile personality. We must adapt to the ever changing kaleidoscope that is our reality. Picking up all the broken pieces from our past and present circumstances and using them as fuel for our engines of imagination.

According to Darwin's Origin of Species, it is not the most intellectual of the species that survives; it is not the strongest that survives; but the species that survives is the one that is able best to adapt and adjust to the changing environment in which it finds itself.

In this exhibition you will see pieces from the artists ‘Antifragile Ceramics’ collection. Which is the continuation of her previous project ‘Smashing Heritage’, where she uses discarded and broken ceramics to create new pieces. (Last shown at the Venice Design Biennial.)

Ivi van Keulen invites you to be inspired. To break free from constraints and open your eyes to all the possibilities imaginable..

The programme is named Untitled_23. Description: Untitled_23 is about vulnerability, making, the safety of home and about being a child. This work was created as a graduation project at the Spatial Design Department of the Utrecht University of the Arts.

Fragile

Puck's creativity has been fragile for as long as she can remember. While shaping her graduation project, she ran into this. She had high expectations, and they had to be pursued. She hindered herself, as she did before. She stopped drawing as a little girl because it wasn't perfect enough, and she held herself back for fear of doing the wrong thing. For Puck, home was the place where everything was okay, where there was no right or wrong and where she could do whatever she wanted. Especially in her own room, which she was always allowed to decorate herself.

In fact, this has always remained so, even now that she no longer lives at home with her parents, but in a small student room. This room is her own safe place, full of all the weird things that belong to her. As a showpiece, there is a cabinet in that room, full of things. A cabinet of curiosities, wunderkammer, museum of oddities or however you want to describe it. All of these items she obtained in a different way, and they all have their own story. They fit together because they fit Puck. This closet is very dear to her; no one is really allowed to touch it.

Tactile cabinet

Puck recreated this cabinet as a spatial self-portrait. The visitor comes to visit Puck at home, where everything is allowed and there are no rules. The cabinet is made entirely of latex, looks fragile but is tactile. The visitor can touch the cabinet, put things in a different place. You can come and play with Puck, be a child again.

About Puck Groot
Puck is a young creator, recently graduated from the Utrecht University of the Arts. Puck's work always starts from within herself. She can become fascinated by everyday things, and in this she always looks for the relationship with herself. The work is personal and close to her. Whether it is something she saw happening on the street, something that has been on the news or is playing out in her personal life. It is thoughtful, but looks playful and almost childlike. Her work is totally Puck.

The programme is named EXIT 2023. The subtitle of the programme is Textile and fashion graduate student exhibition 2023. Description: The Textile and fashion graduate students exhibition 2023, the graduation show of the Swedish School of Textiles, University of Borås, materializes innovative visions of textile and fashion futures.

Creating the future

Nowadays, the fusion between sustainability and design thinking lays the foundation of most artistic professions. Likewise, we see it demonstrated in the textile and fashion design graduates’ works.
Each interpretation of a better tomorrow expressed through textiles and fashion is unique and opens the viewer’s imagination to new uses, experiences, and perspectives.

By analyzing the different design approaches, we can distinguish many voices and nuances led by artistic curiosity and imagination. The student’s degree works 2023 dare to embrace impressive trajectories for future design; they tackle with ambition areas such as digitalization, personalization, transformability, and forms of craftmanship in a way considerate to their profession, to nature, and society, speculating on a sustainable tomorrow through the lens of textile and fashion design.

About THE SWEDISH SCHOOL OF TEXTILES
At the Swedish School of Textiles, we believe you can go anywhere if you have the right foundation. This is why we are confident that our unique melting pot of solid knowledge, cutting-edge research, and interdisciplinary approach will lay the foundation for the sustainable lifestyle of the future

The programme is named Radical City inc.. The subtitle of the programme is Explores routes to an alternative urban landscape. Description: The Radical City inc. exhibition gives shape to a new climate-proof and nature inclusive city. Artists, designers and architects challenge conservative notions of city life and explore different routes to a new, future-oriented urban landscape.

An ongoing exploration of radical ideas for the city of the future

A series of evolving exhibitions provides the basis for an ongoing exploration of radical ideas for the city of the future. The exhibition at DDW 2023 is the second in a row.

In this new urban landscape, the connection between people, nature, public space, objects and architecture is crucial and functions as one balanced system. The symbiosis also provides solutions to complex challenges of our time, such as drought, humidity, salinization, subsidence, pollution and endangered flora and fauna. This city interacts directly with its surrounding landscapes.

The exhibition presents conceptual works, artistic approaches and prototypes. A number of works will be or are actually realized and placed in public spaces. Thus, the city of Amsterdam is not only used as a utopian platform but sets the stage for the first steps towards the city of the future.

The programme is named TerraCool. The subtitle of the programme is Urban Oasis. Description: TerraCool is an innovative architectural solution developed to combat urban heat using ceramics for passive cooling through evaporation. Its unique minimal surface geometries enhance cooling performance and structural strength, allowing seamless integration into architecture.

Evaporative Cooling

TerraCool leverages the inherent properties of fired terracotta, making use of its natural porosity to create a cooling effect. This time-honored technique, practiced in regions such as Iran, India, Egypt, and Spain, serves as the foundation for TerraCool's cutting-edge solution. As water permeates the ceramic surface and evaporates, it efficiently cools the surrounding air.

This innovative project utilizes the cooling potential of hollow ceramic elements, drawing inspiration from advanced heat exchangers. Urban heat islands have become a significant challenge, affecting urban living conditions and health. TerraCool offers an affordable and accessible passive cooling solution using ceramics to create more comfortable urban spaces.

TerraCool is an architectural proposal developed to combat the growing problem of urban heat by using the porous material properties of ceramic to passively cool air through evaporation. Its innovative use of minimal surface geometries provides enhanced cooling performance and strength. The project aims to facilitate the architectural integration of evaporative cooling through its modularity, parametric adaptability, and ease of manufacture.

Innovative Geometry

The geometry of TerraCool was designed to feature hollow geometry with the highest possible ratio of surface area to internal volume. This authorizes the communication between the ceramic surface and air. The logic of triply periodic minimal surfaces inspired the geometry. This logic was influenced by research in advanced heat exchangers for power plants. The geometric conditions of the heat exchangers are similar as they require separate, interpenetrating channels with a high volume-to-surface area ratio. Also, the smooth geometry allows flows to move freely without resistance. Aerodynamic shapes have been shown to enhance evaporation in ceramic evaporators. Minimal surfaces also exhibit high structural integrity. This is important to TerraCool, as the geometry must be self-supporting and able to hold its weight as well as the weight of the water it contains.

Design Process

The design process of TerraCool is driven by a meticulous approach that harmonizes tradition with cutting-edge techniques. It begins with the generation of modular hollow ceramic bricks through a parametric design system, which utilizes input parameters to create curves. These curves are then seamlessly stitched together to form the surfaces comprising individual TerraCool units. The next step involves the fabrication of these units using either subtractive or additive manufacturing methods, ensuring precision and efficiency. What sets TerraCool apart is its innovative use of these positives as molds for multiple brick variations, reducing fabrication time and enabling mass customization. Adjustments can be made based on local climatic factors, allowing the designs to be adapted to best suit specific environmental conditions and available water sources. In essence, TerraCool's design process is a fusion of modern digital technology with traditional craftsmanship, culminating in a versatile and sustainable cooling solution.

The programme is named KD26–A. The subtitle of the programme is Wearable typography. Description: KD26–A is a contemporary kimono, designed by KD26. The design studio will create 26 wearable artworks, integrating the letters A to Z. Along with its accompanying publication, KD26–A is exhibited at Kelderman en van Noort, where a second, unique version is crafted on-site.

KD26–A

KD26–A is the first of a series, consisting of 26 wearable artworks, which will visualize the letters A to Z. The letter A has been translated into a handcrafted kimono, created out of an upcycled 100% wool blanket.

Inspiration for the coat was found in the traditional Japanese kimono and in the origin of the used material itself. The shape of the letter A is based on a ‘moving grid’ and is integrated into the coat with a recycled cotton cord using an enlarged and evolved tufting technique.

The kimono is contextualized within a magazine with the same title. This publication serves as a lookbook with in-depth information about the vision and the process behind this work.

KD26

KD26–A is the first statement-piece created by fashion designer Korinna van Balkom and graphic designer Daan Rietbergen which marks the start of their label KD26. Van Balkom collaborates with diverse designers and artists to create exclusive fashion-items, while Rietbergen designs timeless typographic systems that are brought to life in various ways.

KD26 operates at the intersection of fashion, typography and art and will ultimately realize 26 distinct artworks, starting with the letter A and ending with the letter Z. The garments are the result of form, material and system research.

Experiment is of great importance as it allows KD26 to push boundaries. By working together and using their specific strengths, the two designers elevate each other. Van Balkom brings Rietbergen’s typographic forms to life by systematically and delicately translating them into textiles, while Rietbergen’s unique visual language leads to unexpected adjustments in Van Balkom’s moldings. These parallel processes elevate the garments to unique works of art.

Fashion as a form of art

KD26 takes a critical look at the contemporary fashion industry, where mass production and environmental pollution are the norm. With their work, they aim to revalue fashion as a form of art, designing and crafting each item with respect and consideration for materials, craftsmanship, aesthetics and the environment. They hope to contribute to the awareness of the true value of a garment and the creative and intensive process that lies behind it.

By choosing for a single unique statement piece and embracing sustainable materials and production, they oppose the masses and mass production - KD26–A is exclusive in both design and edition.

During DDW 2023, the kimono and the magazine will be showcased at Kelderman en van Noort, where the two designers will also create a second unique edition of the kimono in a different color scheme. This way, visitors get the opportunity to see the intensive and artisanal production process.

The programme is named SEE through COLOURS. Description: “SEE through COLOURS” is a collection that tries to use colours and silhouettes in garments to blur the boundaries between races and genders.

Read through metaphors

Since when have we associated colours with race and gender? We're labelled by society the moment we're born, such as with gender, race, and nationality, and it's our personal preferences and decisions that allow us to recognise each other. Clothing and colour serve as mediums with the same functionality.

In this project, some designs are muscular, some are feminine, some fall in between, and some are genderless. Additionally, colour is considered a visual language that can strongly impact our decision-making. Thus, I experimented with and tested the possibilities of colours by using layering and scaling methods, including gendered colours like blue and pink.

Let garments be, stop genderization!

In ancient Asian fashion, the flat pattern technique played an important role, as it allowed clothing to be suitable for all genders and body types. Tie-up techniques were often employed to ensure the clothing maintained a proper fit on the body.

Inspired by these intricate Asian costume details and methods, I amalgamated them with classical Western garments such as suit pants and trench coats...

The programme is named Solid Silhouettes. The subtitle of the programme is On the cusp of art and design, Form Editions presents striking outlines in the third dimension – an exploration of materiality and innovative craft.. Description: This exhibition shows new work of the core selection of designers that are connected to Form Editions. Visit us at KEVN in the newly created Collectible Design area of Dutch Design Week, where Form Editions explores the future of collectible design and functional art.

The Exhibition

Form Editions is a platform where art and design converge, connecting collectors to creators. Through this exhibition, we showcase new works from our core collection. These innovative works transcend the ordinary, pushing the boundaries of geometric possibilities while delving deep into the world of materials. You'll discover common threads of shapes in their purest form interwoven throughout the pieces, each manifested in a distinctive personal signature.

The Designers

Frank Penders combines his experience as a photographer, metal worker and civil engineer. A strong combination of aesthetic, conceptual, hands-on and technical qualities that he uses to design to the purest shapes.

Rive Roshan is the artistic practice of Ruben de la Rive Box and Golnar Roshan, with a deep interest in colour, texture and materiality leads to an aesthetic of raw beauty.

Studio Verbaan's handcrafted wooden pieces sit somewhere between furniture, objects and sculpture, the contrast of the minimalistic shapes and traditional craft, goes beyond the object’s functionality.

Marijke De Cock manifests a distinctive series of abstracted, intuitive wall sculptures which, adorned with beads, above all celebrate the desire to create.

Marc Meeuwissen's work 'Dear Objects', tells stories that reflect our time and represents them in 'functional' objects.

Collin Velkoff investigates the fluidity and malleability of function as he attempts to generate narratives through the creation of unique objects. His wide range of experience with materials and their process culminates in the development of new methodologies of creation.

About Form Editions
Form Editions is a platform that connects makers of collectible design to collectors and potential buyers. As a platform it sits somewhere between a collective, label and gallery. The platform focusses on building strong and long lasting relationships with a small group of designers, so that their careers can develop and grow sustainably and they will gain enough income and confidence to invest in a long term practice.

The programme is named Square meters of colour. The subtitle of the programme is Painting with natural pigments found close to home. Description: Miriam Sanders is a painter who creates abstract paintings full of energy.
She loves to make her own paint with pigments from her own environment: from forests to food waste, and all the things her cat has broken in the past 2 years. Each material asks for a different approach.

Natural pigments

There are many different ways to gain pigments from your own environment. Some materials, like sand and stone, can be grinded with a mortar and pestle. Flowers, plants and food waste can be turned into (lake) pigments by using heat, alum and soda. And some metals, like copper and bronze, give beautiful different colours through oxidation.
With this project I show how great the diversity of colours is from my own surroundings and how rich the natural colour palette can be to paint with. The possibilities and combinations are infinite.

Square meters

I collected materials from 6 ‘square meters’ in my own environment. Places that I had access to during my search for pigments.
The materials I used to make pigments from come from:
the forest, the ingredients for guacamole, beaches and islands, scrap metal, flowers and everything my young cat Shizzle has broken since she came to live with me, 2 years ago. I use all these pigments in 6 different abstract paintings, 1 square meter each.

The programme is named Annelies Hermsen @ Van Abbemuseum Vitrine. Description: Food designer Annelies Hermsen presents a selection of works from the Van Abbemuseum's collection in the display case of the Van der Valk Hotel Eindhoven. With works by Marcel Broodthaers, Julia Lohmann and Maryam Jafri. They question the relationship between people and the meat industry.

The work in the display case

Annelies Hermsen focuses on innovative, green and circular food concepts and has worked with the Van Abbemuseum before. The questions Hermsen poses in her work are not only about the difference between animal food and plant-based food, but mostly about the relationship between people and nature, city and the rural area. Annelies selected three works for this presentation: Les animeaux de la ferme (1974) by Marcel Broodthaers, “Belinda” Cow-Bench (2005) by Julia Lohmann and Generic Corner (2015) by Maryam Jafri. As in her own work, these works refer to the role of the cow in the food industry. This display case, which was designed by Piet Hein Eek, is each time curated by a guest curator with works from the collection of the Van Abbemuseum.

More about Annelies Hermsen

Food designer Annelies Hermsen keeps a close eye on developments within the food industry. She develops products, menus for events and provides advice for companies, gastronomy and catering. She is interested in the shift from meat and fish to plant-based food that has taken place in recent years. The shift that is taking place here is something that Hermsen sees more often in contrasts in the food industry: exuberant and social versus functional and healthy.

The display case can be visited free of charge at Van der Valk Hotel Eindhoven.

The programme is named Global Talk. The subtitle of the programme is Starting a conversation to look at groups of people with a different perspective.. Description: Global Talk presents an intercultural method developed by Wasbeer & Pauw. Let’s think about your role in our intercultural society. If you’re up for it, we invite you to move with us.

Everyone has a part to play.

Wasbeer & Pauw works for people, with people, in groups and with groups. Our approach starts with the people, the individuals. They form the group. If you want to get a group moving and function as a healthy unit, you have to discover what is essential to each individual. This also applies to the intercultural society we live in today. Wasbeer & Pauw has developed an intercultural method. Our method takes in account all aspects of an individual, because for us culture is more than someones heritage. By thoroughly listening and observing, questioning and connecting we get groups of people moving.

At our location Schellens Fabriek we take you through the six pillars of our method. With the help of theoretical and practical information, you are asked to think about your role in our intercultural society. If you’re up for it we have some challenging questions and forms of play for you! Applying observation, listening, questioning, play and activities we challenge you to get moving and become aware of your contribution to our intercultural society.

The Experiment

For those who are ready to leave their comfort zone we are organising experience workshops. Stay tuned @wasbeerenpauw

About Wasbeer & Pauw
Wasbeer & Pauw designs solutions for questions regarding human beings in the context of a group. If it’s a team within the structure of an organisation or groups with a distance towards society, everyone is equally important. By having eye for every individual you can create movement as a group. We prove that doing social and successful business can be perfectly combined. As innovator, sparring partner and coach in the field of employment and culture we design products in material and workshops.

The programme is named A place to look forward to. The subtitle of the programme is Barriers in the public space. Description: By altering everyday objects, which we often take for granted, we aim to playfully shed light on the overlooked thresholds. Our installation actively seeks interaction with the audience.

Connect

Our installation is designed as a response to the increasing homogeneity in our environment and the occasional fading sense of community. We aim to create awareness about the barriers that impede interaction in public spaces, while also inviting people to experience these inconveniences.

A staircase that cannot be climbed symbolizes the occasional inaccessibility of places for people with disabilities. The benches that prevent people from seeing each other highlight the limitation of solely installing benches in neighborhoods. An important aim of our installation is to promote inclusivity and restore a sense of community. We intend to encourage individuals to broaden their perspectives and embrace the diversity around them.

Benches

By making the thresholds of our spaces tangible, we aim to promote understanding and empathy, so that people become aware of the impact of these barriers on themselves and others. By creating awareness and inviting the audience to experience the thresholds, a shared experience emerges. People are encouraged to converse and exchange ideas to enhance the inclusivity and accessibility of public spaces.

The programme is named Coping with Mechanisms. Description: “Coping with Mechanisms" is an art installation that addresses the recent rise of anxiety disorders among young adults and teenagers in the digital age. This project showcases the potential of meditative activities that counterbalance the negative effects of daily information overload.

Aim and Intention

Visitors are invited to reflect on their own mental well-being and explore alternative coping mechanisms, while listening to the hidden audio pieces inside the structure. The installation creates a serene environment where individuals can engage in the meditative qualities of activities like crocheting and knitting, as well as listen to young adults talk about coping and their experience with anxiety, with the countering anxiety-related audio environment.

By raising awareness about the impact of anxiety disorders and promoting the benefits of mindful crafts, “Coping with Mechanisms" aims to inspire conversations and action to address this pressing issue. It emphasizes the importance of finding a balanced relationship with technology while prioritizing mental health. Through this project, I hope to empower individuals, particularly the younger generation, to seek healthier ways to navigate the digital landscape and promote holistic well-being.

The programme is named Warm Protest. The subtitle of the programme is Wear the scarf, wear it out. Description: We need to take better care of the earth. As an entrepreneur, Schipper Bosch would like to be an example and inspirer in the transition to a more sustainable world. To make this mission tangible, they developed sustainable protest scarves together with designer Dana Dijkgraaf & Floris Schoonderbeek.

Field Station live at the Dutch Design Week

During the Dutch Design Week they continue the Warm Protest project in an interactive way. The Field Station - the self-sufficient and mobile workshop of Studio Floris Schoonderbeek - on the Ketelhuisplein forms their basis. From here they collect new sounds from the DDW Community. The subject of 'inclusion' in the broadest sense of the word is central. They question and inspire the audience from different angles. What is inclusion? How do we become inclusive in the workplace? How do we ensure that nature becomes inclusive on our shared planet? Tools are offered on site to leave a warm protest for the world of tomorrow. Invited ambassadors share their ideas for inspiration.

They end the DDW with a new design that is made on site by Dana Dijkgraaf and curated by Floris Schoonderbeek and Schipper Bosch. The design is then screen printed live by professionals using biodegradable inks. Through this methodology, they record what is going on in the creative community at the Dutch Design Week. Will you also contribute to the conversation about a better tomorrow?

A multi-layered project

Warm Protest started with colorful scarves with three valuable messages. (Translated) Bye Growth: do more with less. Every day we continue in the known way is a day that our life's existence deteriorates. Symbiocene here we go: it is time for a world in which there is a balance between people, nature and technology. And we demand ice: not only for the polar bears, but also for our children. We must fight climate change, together. This scarf, which you wear and embraces you, literally makes the message tangible and therefore part of your daily life. The scarf reminds you with every choice that you can make, you can make a (more) sustainable choice. And it also conveys the message: by wearing the scarf, you make a statement and open up for discussion. This is how we move towards a better world together. A quest full of small steps, with big ambitions. In addition to the scarves, sweaters have also been made, so that you can also dedicate yourself on the cold days for a valuable conversation and making a statement.

A broad collaboration

For the production of the scarves, there has been close collaboration with fashion designer Sjaak Hullekes (Hul le kes). He started Hul le Kes with Sebastiaan Kramer in response to the fast pace and polluting practices of the fashion industry. Through urban mining, he has collected second-hand sheets in his studio and transformed them into scarves. Marieke Holthuis and Diederik Verbakel of BrightWhiteStudio - an internationally operating design studio specialized in fashion - provided the scarves with the colorful screen print with ecological water-based inks. For the sweaters, a collaboration has been entered into with Twee Jongens.

The programme is named A Mere Excuse. The subtitle of the programme is A Design for the Preservation and Exposure of Turkish Coffee Practices. Description: As some cultures are expanding, it leaves less and less space for others. This issue arises in many practices of everyday life, including coffee practices. A Mere Excuse is a coffee set designed for the preservation and exposure of Turkish coffee practices in the global coffee culture.

Preserving cultural practices

“Souls are neither after coffee, nor coffeehouses; they are after close companionship. Coffee is merely and excuse. “ – Turkish Proverb.

Globalisation facilitates the rapid spread of cultural reference frames. As some cultures are expanding, it leaves less and less space for others. This issue arises in many practices of everyday life, including coffee practices. Almost everyone knows espresso, but how many people have heard of a Jebena, Dallah, or Cezve? Even some professionals in the field don’t know much about non-western originating coffee practices. Can we give some space back to these coffee cultures?

‘A Mere Excuse’ is a coffee set designed for the preservation and exposure of Turkish coffee practices to the Western coffee culture. It aims to set a precedent of creating space in global coffee culture for more culturally diverse coffee practices and rituals. The features of the set are designed to stimulate the surfacing of cultural values of Turkish coffee, enabling the practicer to experience the coffee through a different lens.

The programme is named ((Capsule)). The subtitle of the programme is Hong Kong Design Centre’s Design Exchange Programme in Dutch Design Week 2023. Description: ((Capsule)) is a design showcase curated by Hong Kong Design Centre and a exchange programme with Netherlands under HK's Business of Design Week .The capsule showcase reflects the Hong Kong cultural and socio-economic changes and invites the audience to observe the evolving design trends and impacts

“East-meets-West”

To further raise awareness of Hong Kong's design industry and developing Hong Kong into an East-meets-West centre for international cultural exchange hub, as well as provide opportunities for Hong Kong designers to establish valuable connections with designers and industry professionals in other countries/cities, HKDC is initiating a designer exchange project entitled the ((Capsule)). The project includes a design showcase of the same name ((Capsule)) -- newly curated by HKDC for Dutch Design Week (DDW) in Eindhoven, the Netherlands (21 - 29 October 2023). As an integral part of this project, a tailor-made inspiration trip to join DDW (and others design related destinations in the Netherlands) as well as the DRIVE Festival will be arranged to stimulate their creativity and innovation. The programme is targeted to bring a delegation of 6-8 Hong Kong designers and 1 design mentor to Dutch Design Week.

“Inside Out”

The exchange project aims to take Hong Kong designers "inside out", to learn about the design perspectives of the Netherlands. While the HK designers can gain insights into the unique challenges and opportunities of the Dutch/ EU markets, the counterpart designers can learn more about Hong Kong's design industry and culture, expanding their knowledge and expertise, and how HK designers can bridge their business needs for localization, i.e. how to use design to effectively adapt company profiles, products and services that are originally created and designed for the EU for different and specific needs in the China market. Through visiting the exhibition, overseas audiences can know more about how the compact and multi-layered city of Hong Kong provided a unique environment for the city to be a testing ground that nurtures opportunities for designers of all disciplines to experiment, innovate, and create. It helps to promote Hong Kong’s image as a creative hub in Asia and increase the visibility as a destination for creative talent and investment. Integrated with the exhibition is an inspiration trip that will be arranged to stimulate creative and innovative inspirations for designer

Collaboration Opportunities

Organising this design exchange project with the Netherlands can reinforce and strengthen the partnership between us, generating more synergy and possibilities for collaborations. Such synergy between programmes not only to showcase Hong Kong design talents but also entice like-minded designers from Hong Kong and the Netherlands to engage further, culminating in BODW in November/December 2023 in Hong Kong and fostering collaboration opportunities in the future.

The programme is named MechCircuit. Description: MechCircuit is an innovative prototype design and manufacturing platform. It combines circuit design, structural design, and modeling design using a new type of conductive magnet.

OUR INSPIRATION

For designers, they often lack professional knowledge in circuits and structures, which makes them lack technical means when implementing their creative ideas. MechCircuit, as a design and manufacturing platform, can help them conveniently design in terms of appearance, electronics, and structure. For the product development process, the design of appearance, circuits, and structures are often carried out separately, which ultimately makes it difficult to match between the different parts. This wastes a lot of time and money. The vision of MechCircuit is to complete the entire process together to improve the efficiency of product iteration.

HOW IT WORKS

1. By using a conductive magnet and integrating it into the circuit, traditional static circuits can be made to move. This approach can create some movable structures and easily change the layout of the circuit. It can be widely used in interactive device design, rapid prototype manufacturing, and product development in the future. 2. Developed software tools that can quickly create circuits and magnet structures. Designers, artists, and researchers without a background in circuits and mechanics can quickly get started with design and manufacturing, with a very low learning cost. This can support these groups to freely exercise their imagination to create. 3. By integrating circuit design, structural design, and modeling design together, products can be considered as a whole, which can greatly reduce research and development costs and time.

The programme is named Future Heritage - a very possible meat. The subtitle of the programme is The " Vache Nantaise". Description: Through an immersive scenography the Food Design Lab invites you to get to know a very local cow: the Vache Nantaise. Questioning the place of sustainable cow elevation in the metropolis from its breeding to its consumption in a territory in transition up to potential design leverage points.

The context

The origin of the project is a dialog between the city council of Nantes Metropols and the Ecole de Design Nantes Atlantique to question the place of sustainable cow elevation in the metropolis and how the design methods could help to understand better the complexity and controversy of the topic, to link actors and to create an collaborative tool of mediation.
La Vache Nantaise, which nearly disappeared in the 1970s, has been preserved by a new generation of engaged committed breeders. This unique local breed, associated with an economical and autonomous breeding system, expresses in the current context of securing supplies in the face of health crises its full potential and allows valuation in local short circuits.

The Slow Food association for biodiversity has included Vache Nantaise in its register via Ark of Taste project. It is now the subject of a recovery plan driven by the redefinition of agricultural systems for a transformation of the sector towards more sustainable farming.

The project

22 design students are questioning the place of sustainable cow elevation in the metropolis with a systemic approach, from its breeding to its consumption, the value chain and its role in a territory in full food transition until the question of the culture of eating, quality of food and pedagogy of healthy diets. The exhibition aims to vulgarise information data and demonstrate potential design leverage points and highlight unexpected facets and applications of design in Food.
The relevance of this topic is its transferability to other breeds or local agricultural initiative and showcase how a system switch in food can be enabled.

The installation

The installation consists of two accessible cylindrical barrels of a very simple general shape, covered with a coating of cow dung. The chosen material refers to the cycle of breeding, fertilization and preservation of moist soils. The shape of the barrels insinuate agricaltural architecture like silo or rural storage elements.
Inside, the first barrel hosts an immersive installation illustrating biodiversity of the Vache Nantaise by video and sound effects. The second barrel offer prospective user scenarios, prospecting on the appropriated preparation of specific meat, valorization of distribution points and prospective future dairy products.

A third barrel hosts, which is not exhibited in DDW, complets with a detailed mapping of the actors and the territory in a systemic approach. The research is documented and accessible in the exhibition.

An collaborative wall invites you draw you own cow portrait.

The programme is named Evolumination. The subtitle of the programme is Diversity of a species. Description: Evolumination is a large light design installation at Strijp-S at Microlab Hall, presenting how the form of a species is affected by habitat and calling for exploration by the audience. It is presented by Kollegi, a Finland-based creative collective.

Exhibit

Welcoming you to MicroLab Hall, is our large light installation of unique pendant lights. To enter, you get to walk under it and explore how the shape of lamps relates to the habitat they live in. Together, the lights create an immersive, playful, and visually captivating experience for viewers, enhanced by the colorful dot patterns they cast on the floor. The exhibit reveals itself through exploration, and is open for different interpretations. A satellite exhibit at Klokgebouw presents a small piece of Evolumination.

Form follows habitat

Each corner of the space represents a habitat, with specific conditions. For instance, you can think one corner depicting an arid, desert spot, while another represents a lush grove. Thus, the living conditions in each spot in the space are different, resulting in a unique shape for the lamp there. The lamps in the spaces between the corners blend the characteristics of adjacent environments. For the audience this manifests in a gradient field of change among the population, allowing an exploration and exciting revelations of causality, leaving space to playful, creative imagination.

Diversity in nature and in products

Our installation celebrates the habitats and their effect on biodiversity, fostering a sense of stewardship towards our planet -when habitats are lost, diversity is dramatically reduced. From a computational design point of view, with the installation, we explicate a solution space in a tangible example of 144 unique lamps. The exhibit presents how generative design and digital manufacturing enables unique products, were they individual instances or collections of those.

Kollegi is an international collective of designers and architects residing in Finland but thinking globally. We are driven by interest to bridge digital and physical with computational design approaches, grounding our approach to a joyful compilation of fresh creativity and solid experience in a variety of design fields.

The programme is named BLoOm – Connecting Urban Trees and Humans. Description: BLoOm is an artificial fruiting body that bridges the gap between trees and humans by translating the trees’ stress to humans. In an IoT network, BLoOm communicates with a sensor measuring the roots’ suction force. The sensor’s information is then translated into a pulsing light.

The programme is named Ceramic Touch. Description: If 'home' means comfort and security, then home technologies demand a material change. Through its aesthetic, almost sculptural quality, Ceramic Touch becomes a natural part of the home while enabling digital interaction through subtle touch gestures.

Why Smart Homes are Flawed

When thinking of the technologies entering our homes nowadays, it quickly becomes clear that we actually do want most of their specific conveniences and comforts, yet we are uneasy about their surveilling presence that on occasion parallels an Orwellian dystopia.

The main point of contention seems to be the way we interact with these technologies. Voice assistants are useful yet you may never be sure whether they are secretly listening. Controls through a phone or tablet computer may alleviate this, yet their digital presence can become a sharp intrusion into our home environment - a place that at times we specifically want to be devoid of screens and distractions.

The Ceramic Touch project comes up with an alternative through a number of ideas. At its core is a conceptual ground work, that is then expressed through materials, shape and interaction.

Touch - a Core Way of Human Interaction

To create a new way of interacting with our home technologies, the part we need to question is quite obviously the digital hub that is center to it all. This hub needs to blend into our home environment in both an aesthetic as well as a conceptual way - only open to actively intended interaction, not potentially sovereign in itself. Its technology should be hidden as to not intrude, yet obvious in its functioning as to not raise unease.

As its input, touch was therefore chosen - given it is subtle yet definitive, unobtrusive yet always accessible. Yet more importantly, touch is a core way of human interaction - it comes natural to us and builds deep connection, we trust it for its physical component, which we instinctively know to be in control of.

Ceramics - a Material Change

Equally important however is the material forming the surface to be touched, as it informs whether this interaction is perceived as cold or warm, sterile or welcoming. Commonly used materials such as plastics, metals and glass tend to fall into a more sterile perception, while woods and textiles fall into the historically more homely ones.

A unique material in between are ceramics. It combines the clear and timeless elegance that glass and metals may achieve while having a huge heritage that grounds it firmly in human culture. We interact with ceramics in natural, unforced ways and its aesthetics are inherently tied to attributes we connect with home.

The final object is therefore a culmination of the above.

A sculptural piece of ceramic, defined by crystalline faces for visual clarity and a slightly slanted, concave section which invites the palm to rest on its edge, naturally exploring its shape.

To the unknowing eye, it may just be a show piece displayed for its aesthetic value. Yet the people calling its surroundings home know the intricacies of subtle touches and gestures that will reveal control over the various home technologies around.

The programme is named Afro-Surinamese Textile Heritage. Description: The Afro-Surinamese Textile Heritage presentation at the Dutch Design Week exists of a serie angisa's collected by Jane Stjeward-Schubert, and two full koto costumes made by Tailors and Wearers. The symbols, images and drawings printed on the cloths tell the stories of a community and its history.

The embodied koto and angisa

The kotomisi, with her folded headscarf and voluminous, often colorful skirt, is a recognizable image, even for those without a specific connection with Suriname. Around Keti Koti (July 1), Srefidensi (November 25), during other cultural gatherings and on birthdays, Afro-Surinamese women dress in a koto, a yaki, a short jacket, and an angisa, the starched headscarf.

The release of an angisa has a long tradition within the Afro-Surinamese community that goes back to the end of the 19th century. The angisa is made from a printed piece of textile measuring originaly 90 by 90 cm. In addition to preserve and commemorate events depicted on the angisa, the angisa also often bears a given name (an odo) and some headpieces even have messages passed on through the folding methods. 

Tailors & Wearers is committed to education, participation and presentation of Afro-Surinamese traditional costume, or African Surinamese fashion and heritage. Acting as a platform, we contribute to preserving, developing and making knowledge and skills about this special material and intangible heritage accessible.

About Tailors & Wearers
Tailors & Wearers functions as a platform and is an initiative of koto and angisa expert Jane Stjeward-Schubert, anthropologist Ella Broek and photographer Michelle Piergoelam. They collect different types of knowledge and organize information about Afro-Surinamese costumes, their makers, collectors and their wearers. By making this knowledge and the personal experiences that surround these fabrics, accessible to others, they contribute to preserving/enlivening Afro-Surinamese cultural heritage.

The programme is named BALAMPS. The subtitle of the programme is The lamp that defies gravity. Description: Balamps: A minimalist table lamp, using tensegrity, a balance of tension and compression, for stability. Versatile design with a floating appearance, allowing for customizable lighting effects through structure adjustments

Tensegrity lamp

Balamps is a table lamp that is stable and resistant due to the principle of tensegrity, which results in tensile and compressive forces existing between the components.

Tensegrity refers to a system that remains in balance due to the combination of rigid elements subjected to compression and flexible elements subjected to tension, which in this case consists of the central metal wire. Thanks to this principle, the structure, which seems unstable and floating, maximizes resistance and optimizes the use of components, making the product versatile and minimalist.

The minimalist style highlights the supporting structure, creating an illusory effect that leads the user to wonder how the upper component can support itself.

The principle of tensegrity is also used to obtain different configurations of the structure by changing the forces that support it: by loosening the tensile force of the wire, the upper component can rotate to fit into the lower body and consequently produce different lighting effects.

The programme is named CLIP BENCH. The subtitle of the programme is The evolution of the giant paper clips. Description: See https://lusid.se/project/clip-bench/?exhibition=6423&theme=daeae8&theme_text=4242dd

CLIP BENCH-The evolution of the giant paper clips

When a giant paper clip is bent, what can it be used for? This bench is an aesthetic and visual impact product. It uses the original function of the office supply piece to clamp the seating surface, reminding those around it that this is no ordinary bench. It makes us think again about the ways in which small, ordinary objects can serve us and shape our lives.

This striking creation reimagines conventional seating by taking a quintessential desk accessory and transforming it into an awe-inspiring work of art. Through the process of magnification, the humble paper clip transcends its usual utility to become the supporting leg of the bench. The fusion of these two disparate objects, the giant clip and the seating surface, results in a remarkable hybrid that challenges conventional notions of form and function. Combining these two products different in size by a dozen times creates a novel chimera. It also provides new insight into the many surprises that life holds around us, if only we would notice them.

IMPACT

In a world where tomorrow is the driving force and time seems to be going faster and faster, Studio Range has given shape to an object that invites you to pause and reflect; Impact. An object that reminds you to cherish the moment and gives your memories a physical place
in daily life.

The value of our possessions is often not about the object itself, but rather about the emotional meaning we attach to it. More than just objects, our possessions become an extension of ourselves, you might even say they become the legacy of our memories. Impact introduces a tangible form of memorialization that is fueled by personal stories. With its timeless shape, bright colors and versatile use, impact finds its place in any contemporary setting.

Remember - cherish - pause, in the now.

IMPACT, Table Object

The circular shape of IMPACT symbolizes the cycle of time. With radial waves flowing from the origin of the object, creating an expression of life. The fluid clay is shaped by means of the 4 elements earth, water, fire and air and finally transforms into a still life of craftsmanship. The glass dome portrays the impact of life events, memories captured in a thin layer of glass.

IMPACT is an object that can stand alone in its symbolic strength or may contain either smaller objects or ashes of loved ones.

Cookie Monster

As AI develops, its demand for data increases. Data to AI is like a cookie to the always-hungry cookie monster. It’s thought process when learning or making decisions gets increasingly harder to interpret the more data it consumes. This mysterious process is referred to as a ‘black box’. This idea, however, extends beyond the mathematical. AI’s environmental costs, energy consumption and the misalignment between its values and ours, are all their own respective black boxes. In a series of absurd performative video essays, Yufei Gao embodies the cookie monster to demonstrate how it operates and consumes. The video installation is a research project that aims to understand the cookie monster and its impact on the world.

The programme is named Klei oogst. The subtitle of the programme is Clay harvest. Description: Klei oogst' is a hands-on workshop that provides the experience of transforming Dutch clay soil into ceramics, at a local location. Our unique cargo bike workshop is designed to offer this immersive experience. This project connects the place, the material, and the maker.

#clayground #mobileworkspace #Cargobike

The project "Klei Oogst" offers a captivating journey into the realm of clay transformation, from soil to ceramics, all within the confines of a local setting. In our contemporary landscape, there's a growing emphasis on localized production. Scattered across various locations in the Netherlands lies an abundant reservoir of clay beneath the surface, including near Rotterdam.
The ‘Klei oogst’ has built a network of different clay soil owners, where the klei oogst organize workshops in which you get the experience of developing ceramics by hand. This is a process of hands in clay. How much time and energy does it really take to make ceramics by hand?  Our workshops are ingeniously facilitated using a converted cargo bike, ingeniously fashioned into a mobile workspace complete with indispensable implements. The encounter offers more than a lesson in ceramics; it's an immersive education on the intricacies of Dutch clay soil. Historically, Dutch clay has fueled industries, particularly in the production of roof tiles and bricks. Instead of bringing the material to a workshop, we bring the workshop to the material. This project ‘Klei oogst’ connects the material back to the place.

The programme is named Masculinity Detox. The subtitle of the programme is Fighting the acceptance, tolerance and normalisation of masculine-coded violence. Description: When we look at the topic of misogyny, we are confronted with the reality of femicide. "Masculinity Detox" is a campaign aimed at stopping masculine-coded violence.

Start Listening

Masculinity Detox is a campaign that wants the ways in which men* deal with emotions. In our society they are taught to swallow their emotions and project strength outwards. This often leads them to resort to violence, as shown by the staggering number of femicides around the world.
The project deals with different magnitudes of this gender based violence in the context of the Netherlands and Austria. These topics are brought to a male public through poster series and a video installation. Men are asked to start listening and hearing non-male voices.

The programme is named De-Construction Site. The subtitle of the programme is Reclaiming the city as our collective common.. Description: What
Modern city planning does not allow signs or representation of its community - the public. It predetermines urban environments without our involvement.

How
Recontextualising common construction barriers, converts a symbol of restriction into a place that invites the presence of people.

Where is the public in the public space?

Our cities have become increasingly monotonous and characterless. Planned in big scale and predetermined in shape and colour, there is little room for involvement of the community. The modern design language of the outdoor public space seems to overlook the impact our surroundings have on our behaviour, thoughts and feelings. The environment we spend so much time in should have the ability to mean something to us. Instead we are offered a dull, flat and textureless space that allows little sign of social life or representation of its community - the public.

Recontextualising common construction barriers, converts a movement limitation into an invitation for social interaction. By being given a new purpose, an element that symbolises restriction provokes to reconsider the function of the public space. The barriers are temporarily placed in the public space, which technically makes them public goods. Yet we cannot interact with them, but are instructed on how to behave. Once transformed into meeting places the intention of the object changes and therefore the use of the space around it.

The programme is named (r)evolutionary pleats. The subtitle of the programme is Fenna van der Klei presents an explosion of color and texture in her pioneering design made with a newly developed craft: structural textile pleating.. Description: Inspired by traditional, sartorial pleating techniques, Fenna van der Klei has mastered a new craft: structural textile pleating. This year she presents the result. A sculptural room divider made without adhesive or hard materials is charged with vibrant color and relief that seem to dance in space.

An explosion of colour

The room divider is built as a single standing textile. Its’ carefully selected color surface captivates the eye. The color combinations interact with one’s perception and evoke a sense of movement. Vibrant optical illusions appear soft and domestic, yet shimmery as the facets of a gem. The magical effect is a result of a thorough color research on pleated surfaces and made with structural textile pleating. This freshly developed technique allows to create tall self-supporting textile bodies without the need of other elements.

Reducing the environmental impact of textiles

For centuries, soft textile has been the defining material to add warmth, comfort and lightness to a space. But until this day, textile remains a labour and resource intensive material with a short use cycle. It is often assembled in products in ways that make it difficult to be recycled. In '(r)evolutionary pleats' Fenna van der Klei looks at old textile techniques. She acquires useful knowledge from them and combines it with new production methods in order to develop design solutions with a low carbon footprint, that accelerate the circular economy. The exhibited room divider is proof of this ethos and showcases a wide range of innovations.

A pan-european collaboration

This project has been fruit of an ongoing collaboration between Fenna van der Klei and Fundació Eurecat, a textile technology center based in Barcelona (Spain) and has been made possible by the generous support of the Creative Industries Fund Netherlands, Stichting Stokroos as well as the European WORTH Partnership Projects Fund.

About Fenna van der Klei
Fenna van der Klei is a textile- and product designer with studio based in Rotterdam. She has a deep knowledge of and love for old textile crafts. Her design practice pushes traditions by making old textile techniques clash with cutting edge technologies. In this way, she extends the definition of textile and opens up roads to innovation, making it able to introduce textile in new, unexpected ways. The studio’s main focus lies within the creation of limited editions for avant-garde interiors.

The programme is named The Sticky Glade. Description: JB presents in his own studio a new series of furniture made with leftover wood and duct tape. They are showcased in their natural habitat: The Sticky Glade, a scenography made out of painted cardboard representing an imaginary forest, inspired from his childhood video games.

A fantasy man-made forest

«Autumn has begun in The Sticky Glade. The tree-constructs leaves has fallen and the robot-birds are building their nests. Among the polyurethane flowers and geometric mushrooms, bundles of reclaimed wood have been gathered. Assembled with duct tape, they form a new series of usable furniture for anyone venturing into this man-made grove.»

For this year’s Dutch Design Week, JB Gambier shows us his universe made out of cardboard and duct tape. Starting from his Lumber Stools series, he has been experimenting with the «bundle» technique to build a new set of furniture inspired from the forest. Made from reclaimed wood and resin, these objects are showcased in their natural habitat: The Sticky Glade.

This installation made from leftover materials aims to question what is real and what is fake. By making a natural environment out of industrial materials, JB shares his speculative vision on how nature can evolve with manufactured debris, expressed through imaginary plants and trees. With plastic flowers and polygon-shaped mushrooms, he looks at the way we shape nature, inspired by his childhood fantasy video games.

About Jean-Baptiste Gambier
JB uses drawing, photography and 3D software to create stories, build imaginary worlds and translate them into scenographies, furniture and toys. These works, usually made out of wood, cardboard and scavenged material, showcase a simple, intuitive way to build objects by being assembled with tape.

Description: Doodle series came about during the first corona lockdown, from a need and want to create without having to be too serious and without having to think too much of the end result while having fun in doing.

Doodle series came about during the first corona lockdown, from a need and want to create without having to be too serious and without having to think too much of the end result while having fun in doing. Air dry clay has proven to be an ideal medium to work independently, without having to visit any workshops with a kiln as it doesn't need firing.

Previously Maya has mainly worked with textiles and that’s where she finds a lot of her inspirations for her patterns and colours. Maya’s work is mainly based on intuition, She lets her hands lead the way and sees where they take her.

The programme is named 100% WOOL. The subtitle of the programme is Innovative garments and accessories made in 100% wool. Description: MONO is a fashion and textile research project based in Paris and Eindhoven. In order to facilitate the recyclability of the garments, the collective proposes mono-material fashion products made in 100% wool.

Recyclability

Textile recycling is a complex process due to the presence of mixed fibres and plastic and metal components. Mono-material products avoid having to separate materials before recycling them.
Making products out of 100% wool material makes them meet the demands of the recycling industry and easily recycled on a larger scale.

Wool

Wool is a natural and biodegradable material, with thermoregulatory properties. Crafting with wool offers many opportunities to create new textile products, especially through mechanical processing techniques like fastening by needling, felting, cutting and shredding wool.

About Microlab
MONO collective started in February 2022 during a parisian contest about the future of the wool industry in France. The four multi-cultural members are students and graduates in the fashion, textile and product design fields in Paris. They are currently between Paris and Eindhoven.

The programme is named Goede Gespreksstof - Van Grond tot Garderobe. The subtitle of the programme is Fibershed NL publishes a versatile, creative book for teenagers about the impact of clothing and how we can all contribute to positive change.. Description: This book is an initiative of Fibershed Netherlands. The book invites young people into the world of clothing. Through personal stories from over 20 designers, entrepreneurs and experts, they will learn about all the steps of clothing, which courses and (future) professions will become important.

Why Fibershed created this book?

Worldwide, Fibershed is committed to making natural textiles the new normal within a local, just and circular textile economy.

The founders of Fibershed Netherlands, Stijntje Jaspers and Martine Nieuwenhuis, increasingly realized that changing the textile and clothing industry already starts with how you look at clothing as a young person.

For this book, Stijntje Jaspers therefore talked to entrepreneurs, designers and experts in the field of sustainable textiles and clothing. The result is a richly illustrated book in which the reader learns about the present, past and future of the Dutch textile sector.

Through the book, they learn how the role of clothing has changed from a skillfully crafted product to disposable fashion. And what impact this has on the health and well-being of the environment, people and communities. Based on personal and professional experiences, the reader gains valuable insights into the choices they can make themselves.

The book is written in plain and accessible language, and it is richly illustrated, making it not only appealing for young people, but for all that want to learn more about the impact of clothing and how to bring about positive change.

Role models sharing their stories

Goede Gespreksstof was co-created in close collaboration with participants and partners of Fibershed. For the book, Stijntje Jaspers talked to inspiring role models, such as fashion designer Joline Jolink, AMFI director José Teunissen and MUD Jeans founder Bert van Son. Young people also have their say, such as 12-year-old Yasmine. She says about clothes: "I don't think much about what I wear, but I do like learning to speak."

Broad-based support to start the conversation

Fibershed Netherlands successfully completed the crowdfunding for their book 'Goede Gespreksstof' at the beginning of July this year. In total nearly 15,000 euros was funded through over 200 donations from private individuals and companies. Thanks to their contributions, the first edition of the book will be made available in bookstores across the country for an accessible price (14.95 euros), from oktober 26th 2023.

Of the 1500 copies that can be printed with the crowdfunding money, over 400 books have already been reserved by donors and partners, including for organizations such as Stichting Petje Af, ArtEZ University of the Arts, Clean & Unique and Sprong Living Ecosystem - a joint program of HZ University of Applied Sciences, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences and Avans University of Applied Sciences.

The reason for private individuals to support this project was nicely expressed by André Nijhof, professor of Sustainable Entrepreneurship and Stewardship at Nyenrode Business University, among others: “We need stewards who stretch boundaries of sustainability. That is what Stijntje and Martine do.”

Fibershed US, Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds also support this project.

The programme is named CONCHOPHILIA. The subtitle of the programme is A mythology of womanhood explored through knitted body sculptures. Description: Conchophilia tells a story where each piece is a point in the lifespan of shells and humans, drawing parallels between the individual growth cycles and establishing meeting points through body characteristics and social symbolism.

This collection proposes the use of seashells and their behaviours to create a methodological framework for designing wearable knitted sculptures for the body. The behaviours of exposure, protection, growth, and constriction are used to map out the cyclic life pattern of the woman's body and explore its growth. This cyclic view of the woman's body is rooted in re-imagined storytelling of classic myths, continuing the traditional practice of retelling stories to fit or change the perception of current social constructions. The mythology of maiden-mother-crone is aligned with seashell growth cycle, creating a conceptual dialogue between the two. This creates a dynamic storytelling within the research which informs the behaviour and look of the individual pieces.

The programme is named Door de kieren vervlogen. The subtitle of the programme is An exploration of fragrant nostalgia. Description: Through imagery and scent, Jip Schalkx and Louise Huyghe stir the viewers' nostalgia. Their installation sparks a sense of recognition and belonging, fostering a stronger sense of connection with cherished memories.

Importance of tenderness

The dominant future narrative often highlights technological advancements, efficiency, and productivity. While tenderness, intimacy, genuine connection & and physical interaction get lost in translation to the digital world.

Yet tenderness holds profound significance in our human experience. It envelops us in a world where sensitivity and empathy thrive, forging deep connections among individuals, and fostering an environment of compassion and understanding.

With “Door de kieren vervlogen,” a layer of intimacy, introspection and genuine connection is added to the digital medium, and thus highlights what is often overlooked.

The programme is named Hybrid forms of dressing. The subtitle of the programme is Rethinking the relationship between textile and fashion design. Description: 2D jacquard woven textiles that hold the possibility to be worn as 3D garments through whole-garment weaving. Besides the silhouette and pattern, also details such as pockets, sleeves and labels are woven directly into the textile. Using local materials such as deadstock wool and linen.

Textile and fashion systems

In the current state of textile and fashion design, these two are mostly designed and produced in two separate systems. Only meeting in the final outcome of a garment. Leaving many sustainable and aesthetic textile design possibilities unused, but also increasing textile waste by underutilising material characteristics and by producing unwanted textiles.

In my master project, I created 2D jacquard woven textiles that hold the possibility to be worn as 3D garments. Draped and folded onto the body, these whole-garment woven textiles urge the viewer to rethink the interdependent relationship between
a textile and a garment. For example, colour gradients that look like a worn-out effect have been woven into the textile, but also the labelling, stitch details, sideseams, collars, sleeves and pockets have been woven directly into the textile. Expressing
garment archetypes such as jeans, the party dress or a blazer in hybrid forms of dressing.

Local material

The yarns I used are mostly linen and wool and a mix of deadstock yarns from the Swedish textile industry such as linen from the damast weaving mill Klässbols and tufting wool that is normally used for rugs from Kasthall. Besides that, I also used Swedish wool that has been carefully collected at farms around Sweden and washed and processed in Gotland. Proposing a new and holistic way of designing and producing textiles and garments locally.

The programme is named Natural elasticity - W.I.Y.S.S?. The subtitle of the programme is Influence of overspunnen woollen yarns on material expression, exploring biracial identity and the dissonance between identity and perceived identity.. Description: W.I.Y.S.S?- What is your second skin? explores biracial identity and the dissonance between identity and perceived identity. Body and symbol become one, interchangeable, and influence each other. Made with an overtwisted woollen yarn, the knitted tubes distort and abstract the human form.

How are you precived?

Natural elasticity - W.I.Y.S.S? focuses on reactionary knitwear design and explores the author’s Igbo heritage through the use of colour, rituals, and patterns. The high elasticity and structure of the woollen elastic yarn enable different transparency levels and allow the patterns to change and adapt to the wearer. This ability to distort and abstract the human form represents the nonverbal, additional layer of being by which we are red by our environment.

The programme is named Keigave Kleine Kunst Kamers. The subtitle of the programme is Architecture for kids aged 6 to 100. Description: Come join us making models during the DDW. In this workshop we make space using stairs, walls and patterns. As a start of the design process, we use paintings by Rudi van de Wint: painter, sculptor and builder. All designs will be part of a dune landscape: a large sand table full with architecture.

Dune landscape

Rudi van de Wint (1942-2006) started an artistic experiment in 1980 in an old inner dune area near Den Helder: De Nollen. He merged the landscape, full of bunkers and other defenses from the past, into a 'total work of art' of paintings, sculptures and structures.

Design materials

On behalf of ‘De Nollen Foundation’ we developed an architecture workshop. During this workshop, students are actively introduced to the work and ideas of Rudi van de Wint. In an accessible way the design materials combine landscape, art and architecture.

Making space

You will start designing a new space for a painting by Rudi. What is the shape of that space and how does the light enter? What is the route coming in? And what happens in the space between the structures?

Come by and help build this dune landscape in which Rudi's paintings are given space. You are welcome from Monday to Friday between 1:30 PM and 4:30 PM.

About Architectuurlessen
Architectuurlessen stimulates the use of design thinking in education, with an emphasis on the development of creative, social and making skills. For this we use architecture as a cross-curricular theme. With carefully designed teaching materials, we encourage children aged 4-18 to come up with creative solutions for visual, technical and/or social issues in collaboration.

This is our third contribution to the DDW, where everyone is welcome to inspire themselves.

The programme is named Nederland in 2148. The subtitle of the programme is Imagination of living residential landscapes showing the resilience of the Netherlands.. Description: The Netherlands in the year 2148 will certainly not look like it does today. How will it? Students from the Garden and Landscape Design course have created a model for various areas of the Netherlands, based on six scenarios. Walk through the Netherlands of the future!

Long-term perspective

In 2148, the sea has penetrated far into the land. NAP (Normal Amsterdam Level) no longer exists; it has long since been replaced by NDP: Normal Deventer Level. You can no longer live everywhere, drive, produce food and take a walk in the woods. What then? Our imagination is the key to the future....

The entry from the Garden and Landscape Design course (Van Hall Larenstein University of Applied Sciences) includes an installation that invites visitors to discover the future of the Netherlands through models. The models address the themes of living, working, recreation, infrastructure food production, mobility, nature and energy, each starting from a scenario chosen by the students. They show a physical elaboration for a dozen cities on the scale of the city or of "everyday life.

About Opleiding Tuin- en Landschapsinrichting (HVHL)
The Garden and Landscape Design program is celebrating its 125th anniversary this year. We train our students to become creators and designers of outdoor space, ranging from urban spaces (plaza, street) to landscape. The spatial quality is always central, together with the search for sustainable solutions for our living environment, based on a broad knowledge of planting and landscape. We distinguish ourselves from other courses by a strong ability to visualize plans.

The programme is named Het Project. The subtitle of the programme is transparent wood with help of innobative chemical process and old Japaneese craftmanship. Description: THE PROJECT is a material development project with a social design approach and the main goal of this
project is to change the physical characteristics of wood. the main goal is to give transparency to wood with help of innovative chemical process and old Japaneese craftmanship.

Concept

No society consists only of people born on its own territory. There is always influx of people from
outside. During all those waves of immigration, identity and culture were destination country is
constantly subject to change, partly due to the encounter with the migrants.
The status of the newcomers has proved to be as flexible as the nature of the country of destination
culture and identity. For example, what was 'Dutch' was constantly redefined in relation to the identities
of others. In doing so, an attempt was often made to maintain their own Dutch identity unequivocally
demarcated from that of the 'others'. Dutch images of newcomers trace often not with the way they see
themselves. Not infrequently such images arise from inclination to see others as a mirror image, as the
other side of what one thinks oneself to be. Identity is relative and always exists in relation to others
with whom one measures oneself.

Also the character of the Dutch culture was and therefore is by no
means fixed: it was constantly reinvented with the help of the other as a drop-off point. The same
process also took place with migrants: they too rediscovered their own culture and identity with the
Netherlands as a sales point. Culture is a mobile, changeable product of imaging and construction. There
can be boundary and contact refusal on both sides - paradoxically also a form of culture change - but
also of opening, mixing, absorption, transformation. These new mixed forms can also be called Dutch.
The term Dutch culture can then be viewed both conservatively and as a reserve of the (supposed)
indigenous, more progressive as a culture that is constantly changing, partly because it absorbs what
migrants have contributed in terms of art, views, ways of living and styles. That last view of Dutch culture
is ours. At the same time, we are studying this ongoing redefinition of Dutch culture.

THE PROJECT is a material development project with a social design approach and the main goal of this
project is to change the physical characteristics of wood. In this project, the amount of lignin will soon be
measured during a physical and innovative chemical process (a natural polymer) in wood are reduced (in
chemistry this process is called delignification named). As a result of lignin reduction in the chemical
construction of wood, cellulose and hemicellulose behind and because they are colorless, wood will be
transparent. In fact, we try wood transparent using a physical and chemical process. After removing the
main polymer from wood (lignin), it becomes another natural polymer replaced with white paint. This
means that after the chemical process of removing lignin from wooden surfaces (in this case balsa
wood), surfaces will be saturated with white varnish, which gives stability and strength to the material.
In the final phase, material is translated into light objects in abstract forms. For this will mean white LED
light are used to put more emphasis on material transformation.

The programme is named Monuments. The subtitle of the programme is Design autodidact Daniel Heilig feels close to architecture autodidacts like Tadao Ando. His fascination for iconic architecture flows into MONUMENTS.. Description: MONUMENTS quotes iconic architecture. Designer Daniel Heilig transposes great architecture into interior design. He creates furniture sculptures that play with analogies between architecture and furniture design and breathe traditional craftsmanship.

Inspirations & influences

MONUMENTS stands for a refreshingly non-conformist body of work with exceptional conceptual reference and significant furniture creations that are palpably inspired by intercultural architectural epochs and craftsmanship. Daniel Heilig boldly transfers stylistic elements, building details and volumes from representative, monumental, sacred or contemporary architecture, and historical craftsmanship into modern furniture sculptures. The PAGODE NAGURI stool, for example, refers formally to pagoda architecture, while its wooden pattern quotes the ancient Japanese art of Naguri. The window cross in the Church of Light by Tadao Ando flows into the OHUS seating furniture, which is radically reduced to a steel cross and wooden board. The minimalist wooden body of the PONTI side table translates the historic Porta Nolana city gate in Naples. The revolutionary stool HAPPENS is inspired by chance and plays formally with the concept of the tilted twin towers Puerta de Europa in Madrid.

Rediscovering traditional wood craftsmanship

Daniel Heilig is fascinated by traditional wood craftsmanship. With MONUMENTS, he integrates the art of coopers, boat builders or carpenters. The furniture is exquisitely handcrafted by the designer in his own studio in Germany.

MONUMENTS stands for Collectible Design pieces

MONUMENTS stands for signed unique pieces, small series, limited editions and collectible pieces with soul, aesthetic poetry and authentic history. Created for the lifestyle and mindset of modern nomads and individualists who love contemplative design oases, minimalist everyday furniture and atmospheric interior design. DDW visitors will experience 10 MONUMENTS objects visually, haptically and atmospherically. Accompanied by object documentations, craft making-ofs and material explorations. Each piece of furniture comes with a flyer to take home. QR codes lead to the designer website. Daniel Heilig is at the stand.

About Heilig Objects
Daniel Heilig is a free spirit, interior designer, founder and owner of the HEILIG OBJECTS brand. He manufactures his furniture by hand in his own workshop in Germany. The self-taught designer is supported by excellent design students who develop their own creative potential and non-conformist ways of thinking with him.

The programme is named Brick: a medium to reveal (de)colonial history. Description: This critical design project researches the context and historical significance of Fort Zeelandia, Dutch Formosa (nowadays Taiwan). In the form of an educational toy, research zine, and interactive website, this project reveals how colonial dominance was represented through brick(laying).

Agency of Brick(laying)

How history can be taught through material and/or artefacts? Two prototype series were made as a way of sorting out the geopolitical development of Ford Zeelandia since Dutch Formosa. In combination with artistic reinterpretations of both visual elements and historical archives, the results of the critical-making process can be seen as constructivist pedagogical props - internally and publicly.

The programme is named Embassy of Water. Description: The Embassy of Water gathers the water design of the past five years and brings it together in a pavilion at Stadhuisplein during Dutch Design Week 2023 (DDW23). Expect a grand plan for water restoration for homes, a new way of thinking about water, and more.

Imagine the following:

Buildings act as a collective, natural purification system, where we borrow water from the water cycle and return it cleaner and healthier to nature. Water is interwoven into the architecture. We clearly see the power of nature, and we all understand how essential it is to take care of water. That’s why residents and their homes work together to restore the water cycle and water quality.

A dream? A utopia? Not for the Embassy of Water

During DDW23, we present an ambitious comprehensive plan that brings together the water design of the past five years by the Embassy of Water, in a water pavilion at Stadhuisplein. There, we demonstrate how regenerative water design in housing can look in practice. Our dream is very realistic. We can locally reuse, purify, revitalise, give space to, and appreciate water in and around our homes. The technology is available, as is the mindset. Listening to water forms the foundation.

Stadhuisplein as the centre of water

We project our vision onto the planned new buildings around Stadhuisplein. Over the next few years, more than 1200 homes will rise in impressive high-rises in the centre of Eindhoven. In our plan, this location is transformed into the city’s water centre: the Water House.

Here, the residents’ used water can be purified. We make optimal use of rainwater and no longer extract water from the ground. The water is reused, so the new homes will no longer be connected to the sewer system.

If we can restore water to its original, vital form, we will get a livable city in return. The Water House becomes the blue heart of that transformation. Together with water, we change our living environment into a thriving one.

The programme is named Dommel Vibes. The subtitle of the programme is The Dommel is a dynamic river flowing through a burgeoning city. How can we ensure that this waterway continues to play a shining role for Eindhoven?. Description: Dommel Vibes dives into the rich life of the most important water in Eindhoven. Planting and water enrich the quality of city life for people and fauna. Offering opportunities, but also making demands of our growing and densifying city. So we are looking for a smart approach for now and the future.

Where there’s water there’s a way

City water reveals contrasts and makes conflicting wishes tangible. Between economy and climate, urban densification and quality of life, biodiversity and recreation. How can we best respond to the wish for a greener and more water-rich environment in a growing city? And are we talking about parks or nature reserves?

These issues demand an intensification in collaboration and innovative solutions from different perspectives. From residents, industry and parties like the Water Board. Without losing sight of the interests of flora, fauna and water.

Optimum symbiosis

Eindhoven municipality is collaborating in various projects. The objective is to increase awareness and create support, unifying contradictory wishes, and reaching optimum symbiosis between naturally occurring water and our city.

Exhibitions with in-depth programme

In Dommel Vibes you see and experience how collaboration on water is taking shape, the results and where it can lead. Pivoted around three inspiring exhibitions. In addition, we will be organising an in-depth programme of lectures and workshops for stakeholders and interested parties.

About Gemeente Eindhoven

The programme is named Energy Futures : Co-designing. The subtitle of the programme is How can a novel bio-technological energy system be designed to foster human-centered and planet-centered sustainability?. Description: Energy futures proposes a novel energy production method for breweries using biotechnology. It showcases the need for co-design in energy systems to improve energy literacy, repurpose waste as a resource, and foster responsible innovation.

How can breweries propose a future of energy?

By leveraging brewing waste by-products like brewery wastewater and spent yeast, I propose an energy-resilient brewpub that utilizes biotechnology to locally produce energy. Using an innovative biotechnological approach, Magnetotactic Bacteria are employed to consume these by-products and clean the wastewater while growing. These bacteria have the ability to crystallize iron, making them magnetic. By culturing, isolating, and magnetizing the bacteria, we can pass them through power reactors with copper coils. As the magnetic bacteria flows through the system, the changing magnetic field induces an electric current across the coils, generating energy. This energy-generation process is showcased through a pub table, allowing customers to witness the production of energy as they enjoy their drinks. This project emphasizes co-design, involving experts and engaging end-users, people. By integrating energy education with technological development, the project promotes human-centered and planet-centered energy design.

Why do we need to think of an energy future?

The energy crisis in the UK has brought to light the social, economic, and environmental implications of poor energy management and system design. One such social repurcussion is the shutting down of several pubs and bars threatening London's historic pub culture. Rising energy poverty engulfed in energy illiteracy has made chugging down a beer at favourite spots a looming question. Despite the rise in net-zero transitioning energy systems, the lack of public awareness and biassed policy lobbying has impeded their scalability. Thus, there is a need for upcoming novel energy solutions to cater to all stakeholders in their development process which invites conversations of such complex yet necessary discussions around energy with people.

How does design thinking promote responsible innovation?

The key aspect of this project is to bringforth co-designing with various stakeholders. For this project a range of technical experts in wastewater, microbiology, electrical engineers, and government authorities dealing with councils in London and energy decentralisation, and the final stakeholder who are the end-user : people, were involved. The project's core value is inclusivity and equitable sharing of information around complex innovation for every stakeholder to take part in the co-design process. To facilitate this dialogue, an interactive pub table is featured as a public engagement tool, showcasing an emerging technology that has the potential to revolutionize energy generation in a symbiotic relationship with nature. The different processes involved in energy generation using brewery waste have been presented in a visually explanatory and intriguing manner for people to deliberate over the future of such technologies. These allow for different stakeholders to offer their recommendations to improve these energy systems.

The programme is named Design for Transition - What's on your Menu?. The subtitle of the programme is Tasty conversations about futures at the dining table. Description: Visit University of Twente (UT) at Ketelhuisplein and blend futuring with the art of cooking. In this interactive exhibition, you will explore how your values interplay with presents and futures and discover the role of design for societal transitions.

Design for Transition

The relationships between society and technology are dynamic, with multiple agents influencing how our futures unfold. These dynamics are putting design practices in a continuous state of transition. Design research, including futuring, plays a vital role not only in envisioning but also in shaping the path ahead. To enable the collective shaping of futures, the Responsible Futuring approach emphasises the importance of fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among stakeholders such as citizens, academics, engineers, scientists, and policymakers. To this end, we organise ‘transdisciplinary co-speculation' processes to connect individual perspectives and experiences. Through this interconnection, we can collectively imagine and explore potential futures that inspire us.

Cooking your futures

We propose a metaphorical approach, inspired by cooking, to facilitate reflection and dialogue around societal challenges. Just as cooking entails gathering ingredients, our metaphor involves the collection of values, shaped by past experiences. Imagine the kitchen as a representation of our presents, where visitors use their values to create a dish symbolising their personal stories in today’s context. Finally, visitors gather around the table with their dishes to explore shared and diverging perspectives and envision futures together. Collaboration and co-speculation are essential for exploring and formulating inspiring futures and driving positive change in society.

About University of Twente
At the University of Twente, we are pioneers in fusing technology, science and engineering with social sciences to impact the world around us. Our driving force as students, scientists and educators is a deep sense of connection with people who share a curious, entrepreneurial spirit.

The programme is named Women & Design - Market and talks. The subtitle of the programme is Design by and for women. Description: Charis Stephanie organizes Women & Design - Market and talks. This event is for the underrepresented woman in design. In the Steentjeskerk the designers expose and sell their products and during the talks they talk about how design for women can contribute to society.

Market

The ‘Women & Design Market’ is an exposition and market in one. This place is meant to give female designers some extra attention, lets them be seen and heard. Women in design and art are still underrepresented in for example museums and galeries and earn up to 50% less than their male colleagues. On design and art academies more women graduate, but this is not shown in the work field. With a drink in your hand you can talk to the designers, listen to their process behind their designs and actually buy their work.

Talks

In the ‘Women & Design Talks’ social researcher Françoise Molenaar - who wrote articles for the Correspondent about women's experiences with medical care - starts discussions with doctors, designers, system-changers about how the female medical experience can be better and what design solutions are possible. Backed up by Zoë Sluisdom, colleague of social design bureau Afdeling Buitengewone Zaken - they create three interactive sessions with the subjects 'The empowered gynecology experience', 'Trauma-sensitive gynecology' and 'Giving better birth', where your experience can be of value too.

The subtitle of the programme is For the first time, students from Luca School of Arts Ghent (textile design) and Genk (productdesign) come together and have their work intertwine.. Description: Students from Luca School of Arts Ghent (textile design) and Genk (product design) meet for the first time during the Dutch Design Week in 'De Fabriek' in Eindhoven in a group exhibition where they intertwine their graduation projects where the objects play a central role.

Innovative design and art practices take place in the synergy between art and design.

Innovative design and art practices take place in the synergy between art and design. All these graduation projects are embedded in a broad research framework within the domain of art and design, and the overlaps that arise between them. For example, textiles are not only seen as a material, but also as a medium for propagating cultural values, meanings and the spirit of the times. Product design is used as a search for identity, as a visual representation of socially critical issues and as an exploration of a sustainable future. The themes that are discussed are diverse and relate to various contexts in which textiles and design play a role. The projects display playfulness, contrariness and critical reflection. They view their discipline as an open medium that mixes with other disciplines and responds to the complexity of the world. Reality and imagination go hand in hand and sometimes even take a leap into the unknown of science fiction. The meeting of these two disciplines invites dialogue and exchange.

Harmony of Meetings / De Ontmoeting

Is an interactive art installation specially designed to stimulate social interaction and encounters between people. With its striking shape and vibrant colors the visitors get invited to relax, sit and play, while also enjoying the surroundings.
Playing with tactility that almost seems like an optical illusion, where the artwork is softer than the eyes would have you believe.

Above all, the artwork emphasizes sustainability and the reuse of materials, making it a wonderful example of an environmentally conscious approach to art and design. This artwork was created after a special encounter with the Cooloo factory, a progressive furniture and interior design company that is committed to circular design and the use of recycled materials. For this unique project, residual pieces of soft foam has been used from the Cooloo factory.

‘Harmony of Meetings’ is not only a work of art, but also a symbol of collaboration, creativity and a conscious choice for a greener future.

The programme is named Exploring Posthumanist Design through Making. The subtitle of the programme is The workshop in which you can explore how to DO to make more-than-human or posthuman design.. Description: Posthumanist and more-than-human design want to stop focussing on just the human, and include also every non-human in designing, to design more sustainably. But how does one do this? Join me in the 45 minute workshop in which we cover practical posthuman-design methods to apply to your practice.

Posthumanist and More-Than-Human

Imagine if we were to design more in touch with the world around us. By doing so, we could actively challenge our current unsustainable and consumption-driven patterns. This is where posthumanist design, or more-than-human design, comes in. Rather than prioritising human needs above all else, this approach asks a compelling question: what if our design ethos placed the well-being of the entire ecosystem first? This includes not only humans but also animals, plants, materials, and even insects.
The philosophy of posthumanist design encourages us to adopt a holistic standpoint, fundamentally altering how we practice design. In this perspective, products and humans are not isolated entities, but interconnected components of the larger system that is our world. By embracing this inclusive mindset, we can move towards creating products that work in harmony with the diverse web of life, fostering sustainability and resilience in ways that were previously unexplored.

The Workshop

The theory is present, but how do we put it into action? This is what I explored during my graduation from Industrial Design @TU/e. In a 45-minute workshop, we'll explore the three techniques which for me made the difference between designing for humans, and designing for the world. They are derived from prof. Ron Wakkary's posthumanist design approach, and will be discussed via a fun and accessible hands-on activity I explored in my graduation: wool dry felting (no experience needed!). While creating and designing, we'll discuss these techniques, allowing you to witness the theories in action and enabling you to implement them in your own work as soon as tomorrow! And even if you don't consider yourself a designer right now, you can still join in, create, and contemplate innovative ways to contribute to a more sustainable and improved world.

Workshop dates: 21 - 24 - 28 - 29 October, starting at 13:30.

The programme is named Embassy of Circular & Biobased Building. The subtitle of the programme is If we want to build a sustainable world, we must consider the entire system.. Description: The Embassy explores new perspectives for a sustainable living environment in collaboration with stakeholders and knowledge partners from the construction and agriculture sectors. Through storytelling and imagination, we involve experts and the general public in this research and its outcomes.

Possible Landscapes

Possible Landscapes is a research into a new green, regenerative economy “from land to building” and how it can contribute to societal challenges. Biobased construction offers opportunities in various areas: improving biodiversity and the quality of soil and water, new business models for farmers, a healthier work and living environment for residents and builders, and the prevention of resource scarcity.

We explore what the chain looks like – from soil to building, crop to industry, and ideal to a financially fair value system.

Two programme lines will be presented in various locations over the coming years, including during Dutch Design Week (DDW) and other moments and places. This intentional exposure generates awareness and dialogue. We develop potential landscapes for rural areas and the built environment.

Possible Landscapes rural areas

We work locally and collaboratively with stakeholders from the entire chain, such as farmers, processors, builders, residents, policymakers, designers, and ecologists. Through imagination and storytelling, we make the possibilities tangible through scale model installations. This visualisation provides starting points for further discussions about potential biobased chains and corresponding landscape implementations.

What is possible in a wetland landscape? In May 2023, we opened the scale model installation “Possible Landscapes Wetting” at Nature Gateway De Peel. This installation presents scenarios for areas that need wetting, such as a raised bog area facing dehydration challenges or stream valleys that need rehydration. The installation showcases several possibilities at different scales, guiding the visitor through each level. This model will also be exhibited at DDW23.

We have now initiated a Possible Landscapes programme focused on dry sandy soils, where we examine a location in the Achterhoek region as a concrete case to develop scalable scenarios. We will present the progress of this research during DDW23.

Possible Landscapes built environment

In 2024, the Embassy will launch a new program: Possible Landscapes Built Environment. This programme revolves around nature-inclusive and regenerative construction, building with nature. It’s a way of construction that goes beyond limiting the damage caused by building and adds ecological and social value. During DDW23, we will organise a kickoff event to share the research questions for the upcoming years. The conference will also mark the start of a broad coalition of individuals who want to shape nature-inclusive and regenerative building collectively.

The programme is named Designing Sustainable North Stars. The subtitle of the programme is A new holistic approach to design truly sustainable products, that takes into account product, user and system. Description: A newly developed design approach to tackle complex sustainable challenges in a holistic way. A unique process which show cases elements of physical and digital design, product engineering, user research, system thinking and service design, applied to a consumer electronic product: a baby monitor!

Bliss: a tangible concept to show case the effectiveness of the Sustainable North Star approach

Sustainability represents the next step for the design & innovation competence. Truly sustainable solutions require a much more holistic way of investigating and tackling design challenges: from product and user, to a system perspective. In this exhibition we will show case how five different competences worked together in an organic way to develop Bliss, a Sustainable North Star for baby monitors. This concept represents a new value proposition, which leverages core user needs to enable a more sustainable consumption. A solution designed to provide an engaging experience, from its first use till its last. After creating a tangible proof of concept of the key technologies behind this concept, a detailed transition roadmap was developed, to guide a manufacturer from the design of today to the long term vision. Join us to learn more about this new process and engaging concept!

The power of visual thinking unleashed

Sustainability is a systemic and complex challenge. In this exhibition we will show how we used visual thinking and storytelling to synthetize system complexity and a large number of insights, into one single visualization. We called this visualization Product Journey Map, and we used it guide the development of Bliss. This single Map integrates the full Value Chain of the product, the User Journey, the End of Life, the Environmental impact of different phases of the product life cycle. Key insights collected during the process are then mapped throughout this comprehensive visualization and used to spark design ideation and guide the redesign.

Sustainability as a spark for radical innovation

With this work, we want to show how sustainability is not just important because of upcoming regulations, to follow marketing trends or to avoid a climate disaster. It can be a powerful way to design new propositions and innovation to solve core user needs in a completely different way. When designing in a sustainable way, we are looking at the same problems with a new lens and perspective. This can lead to creating completely new value propositions; entirely new product segments. Sustainability can trigger new competitive advantage in sectors where innovative advantage is saturated.

The programme is named Designing with composite material waste. The subtitle of the programme is Conceptual prototypes demonstrating the possibilities of reusing composite material in new applications.. Description: The difficulty with recycling composite materials is expected to result in millions of tons of waste. Three graduate students from the TU Delft explored the possibility of reusing these composites in new applications to preserve the value embedded in the material and developed a design approach.

Recapturing value through design

Since there is much uncertainty around designing with reused composites, in compliance with the circular economy, little to no value of the material is recovered. This is in stark contrast to the original value of the material. Therefore, three projects from the TU Delft, not only aim to reuse composite material in order to retain this value embedded and minimise the extraction of new and finite resources, but also propose a design approach to achieve this.

This approach has been labelled: Recapturing value through design. This approach starts with an exploration of the source of the material, identifying the types and quantities. Then, with the material as a starting point the designer develops an understanding of the material value through its character and processing possibilities after which the value is captured within an application that suits the intended vision.

Three different conceptual prototypes (a lamp post, bus shelter and bridge) are the first result of this approach. They function both as an example of the method and a stimulus to act on the importance of circularity, also with regards to composite material, and will be showcased at the Dutch Design Week.

The programme is named Wings for Aid. The subtitle of the programme is Wings For Aid has developed a Remotely Piloted Aircraft System to deliver humanitarian relief aid to people in need in hard-to-reach locations.. Description: As industrial design partner, Accenture fuels Wings for Aid's creativity, shaping remote-control systems, self-landing boxes, and more. Using rapid prototyping, we refine and challenge concepts, uniting stakeholders around a shared vision on humanitarian help and social sustainability.

Prototyping serves as our chosen language to align stakeholders towards social justice

We are bound by so many regulations, especially when it comes to humanitarian aid. It requires cross-border insights and a multidisciplinary team to approach ideas from different angles and to map the frameworks and possibilities. Testing, failing and testing again to find solutions that add value to people’s lives in times of need.

Partnering with Wings for Aid and other specialized third parties to bridge the last gap when delivering first aid supplies. A project of this size requires a holistic view on all the topics involved; from technical opportunities to the box itself that contains the supplies. Asking ourselves a lot of questions: How will this drone reach its destination? How will it hold the package? Finding temporary solutions for testing and improvement. And coming up with ideas such as developing a security system that prevents the boxes from falling when they are not yet supposed to be dropped.


In this exhibition, we will be presenting one of our latest collaborations: the utilization of vision model technology to ensure the secure airdrop of the self-landing boxes. We will demonstrate how rapid iteration and prototyping have facilitated the alignment of vario

The programme is named C.O.W.. The subtitle of the programme is Circular Organic Waste. Description: C.O.W. is a self-sufficient cooking station for local communities. Just as in a cow's stomach, biogas and biofertilizer are produced using a fermenter through the bacterial decomposition of cellulose in a CO₂-neutral way.

An open source cooking station with self-sufficient energy generation

Organic waste is a resource from which cooking gas and bio-fertilizer can be generated through the bacterial decomposition of plant residues and manure. The cooking station utilizes this process, locally providing independent energy for food preparation/production, strengthening social interactions within the community and relating energy use to consumption in a tangible way. The open access blueprint empowers anyone to start their own gas production using low-cost common finished products.

The programme is named Poscura. The subtitle of the programme is Intelligent workwear clothing for geriatric nurses. Description: Poscura is intelligent workwear clothing for geriatric nurses. It provides physical support during back-straining activities while reminding the staff to maintain an ergonomic posture.

Short Description

Nursing staff has to deal with a high physical workload. Especially staff in geriatric nursing often suffers from complaints along their musculoskeletal system. The aim of this project is to find a solution for reducing the physical
workload of geriatric nurses. Poscura (engl. posture and lat. cura “care”) is intelligent workwear clothing for geriatric nurses. It´s inspired by the new passive exoskeleton technologies and functional wear and gives physical support in back-straining activities while reminding the staff of an ergonomic posture. A partial elastic system which is integrated in the clothing makes this effect possible. The aim of this project is not to displace any current solutions for medical equipment or traditional working methods in the care sector. The opposite is the case: The concept can be seen as a logical addition to the current working life of nurses and can be integrated in the everyday work of geriatric nurses with ease.

The programme is named Lana. The subtitle of the programme is Economics of Transition, means and Strategies for Resilient Systems. Description: “Lana” experimentally investigates the possibilities of innovative use of pre-consumer wool waste for the bio-assembly of mycelium-based composites that can be used in architecture. The research include material prototypes, material and technology set-up, demonstrations of potential applications.

Wool from hazardous waste to resource

Mountain sheep wool is a resource that has lost value in Europe in recent decades. Especially in mountainous regions such as South Tyrol, where sheep farming is strongly rooted in tradition, large quantities of wool accumulate, which is a hazardous and difficult waste to dispose of and which burdens farmers' costs.
The Lana project experimentally investigates the possibilities of innovative use of pre-consumer wool waste for the bio-assembly of mycelium-based composites to be applied in architecture.
The material-based design research was translated into material prototypes, an experimental material-technology setup and application demonstrators. Furthermore, the feasibility of the concept was illustrated by designing a synergies framework between local suppliers, based on a safe and efficient circular use of local resources.

The programme is named Wave. The subtitle of the programme is A psychedelic, immersive dance film.. Description: ‘Wave' - a psychedelic, immersive dance film, in which a dancer's body is manipulated in time through the use of repetition, delay and the repositioning of frames. This creates a choreography in which the history of a movement forms a new kind of organism.

A group choreography performed solo.

Every movement affects the overall shape of the group. The dancer's past transforms into being its direct shadow.
'Wave' will be a film that, due to the use of 360° - 3D, is more than a film that can be viewed from a distance. The use of VR gives an opportunity for the viewer to be an unnoticed observer who is visually in control of time and can act as a director of the movements and choreography.
An extra dimension is added through the use of digital manipulation, which can evoke emotions such as e.g. claustrophobia, euphoria or surprise.

About Bart Hess
Crossing boundaries between design, fashion and art, Bart Hess' oeuvre is a series of studies into materiality, (virtual) reality and technology. Hess work is characterised by material experiments, (animation) video and photography with the relationship between man and material, nature and technology at the centre. He is fascinated by the human body and always looking for the tension between attraction and repulsion when exploring the intimate relationship that materials have with our skin.

The programme is named To Riso Or Not. The subtitle of the programme is Results of a masterclass in which six makers are challenged to experiment with different printing techniques. Description: Results of a masterclass in which six makers are challenged to experiment with different printing techniques

With Wobby.Club we are developing an experimental long-term programme entitled To-Riso-or-Not.

"Riso-or-Not" consists of working sessions with a selected group of young illustrators and artists, which changes every year. They are challenged to experiment not only with the fast Risograph but also with other printing techniques that are possible in the graphic workshop. (The Risograph is a low-threshold and popular means of printing. It is faster and cheaper than screen printing and particularly suitable for small and medium-sized print runs).
The aim is to offer different graphic techniques, not so much as a reproduction technique, but more as a way of initiating thinking processes: the workshop as a ‘think-tank’. The mutual synergy, the confrontation with different techniques and materials in all their possible combinations, offers the participants a 'pressure cooker' in which they discover new aspects in their work, share knowledge and develop their talent.

About Make Eindhoven i.s.m. Wobby.Club
We are Make Eindhoven. Three workshops under one roof in the centre of Eindhoven. A sanctuary for creative and artistic makers who want to explore the possibilities of material and technique. A place to experiment, innovate, create and stimulate; to share knowledge.

The programme is named Objects for Wellbeing. The subtitle of the programme is Enhancing individual health and happiness. Description: A+N Studio (Alissa+Nienke) have been creating signature walls and innovative surfaces since 2014.
Objects for Wellbeing is an overview of their newest products with which they continue their aim to design interior products that appeal to the senses and enhance individual health and happiness.

Breathing Light

Did you know we take 23.000 breaths a day? Mostly without focussing on it.
While taking control over your own breathing pace is a great tool towards relaxation and de-stressing.

Breathing Light introduces moving spots of light that replicate the gentle rhythm of breathing, aiming to stimulate viewers to breath along and reduce their stress level. While at the same time the movement and colour changes are based on natural phenomena, in line with the Attention Restoration Theory*. The project is developed in close collaboration with a behavioural psychologist and a light scientist.

Breathing Light is designed for SWVO (Samenwerkingsverband VO Waterland) and research and development prototypes were tested with two school communities in the Dutch city of Purmerend.
*The Attention Restoration Theory proposes that exposure to nature (or scenes of nature) can improve our focus & ability to concentrate.

Touch Me Please

Touch Me Please comes to life when you touch it. It is essentially an interactive installation that converts touch into sound. This appeals to three basic senses: the visual, auditory and tactile senses. The activation of those senses provides a moment of escape from everyday life, grounding, or even connecting with others in a different way.

This wool felt wall was developed in close collaboration with a behavioral psychologist, Philadelphia Zorg, and the residents of two residential care locations (Wateringen and Amsterdam), mainly elderly people with dementia, Down syndrome or on the spectrum of autism. Our goal is to decrease the anxiety of the residents when they are high in their emotions, through interaction with the wall.
With this research wall we are researching the effect of different textures, of which a sensor records when and where they are touched. In addition, interviews are held with residents and employees.

So far we see that people’s posture relaxes, they smile more and that it promotes communication between residents and care staff. The research is still ongoing, and we are working towards a further development.

Metamorphosis

Metamorphosis is a custom made room divider that’s sensitive to air flow. Consisting of thousands of individual shapes, the geometric surface transforms into an organic structure when it moves. Metamorphosis is poetic and refined, enriching the everyday environment.
It activates, triggers your senses and stimulates concentration and focus, inspired by the Attention Restoration Theory*.

The screen is double sided, and made of steel strings and components with Japanese laminated shoji paper shapes. The possibilities in size, shape and patterns that can be made are endless.

*The Attention Restoration Theory proposes that exposure to nature (or scenes of nature) can improve our focus & ability to concentrate.

The programme is named RIZOOM. The subtitle of the programme is A series of reflective light objects that invite you to look at reality in a different way.. Description: A rhizome is an underground root structure that grows horizontally, proliferating rampantly and producing a multitude of lines and branches.
It is a symbol for thinking without a straight line or fixed structure, in a network of ideas and thoughts that constantly creates new connections.

APTUM x Lucas & Lucas

In biology, a rhizome is defined as a network of roots that seem to begin or end nowhere. Underground roots that unrestrainedly proliferate, interlock and form connections at seemingly random intersections. The rhizome is always becoming.

The rhizome also symbolizes a way of experiencing reality. According to philosopher Deleuze, it is a non-linear way of thinking, without a fixed structure, like a non-hierarchical network that constantly takes new paths and creates new connections. A network of thoughts and concepts where at every intersection something new can arise.

Creativity is flexible and productive in a rhizome. It offers the unstoppable flow of ideas space to find its way along untrodden paths. At every point where the living network creates a connection, something new begins. Creativity gives the rhizome meaning.

With this in mind, Aptum Customized Lighting Creations and design studio Lucas & Lucas joined forces. With a shared love for innovation and creativity, they designed a series of light objects that give space to the imagination and invite reflection.

Magical Lighting Creations x Everyday Wonders

Aptum is known for its innovative approach to lighting and creates unique and eye-catching lighting objects. The designers of Aptum see lighting as a form of art and self-expression and strive to illuminate spaces with wonder and magic.
Inspired by objects from everyday life, Lucas & Lucas design surprising design objects. Characteristic of the way they work is their playing with form, color and material and striving for a minimalist aesthetic.

Enlightened Reflections

The collaboration between Aptum and Lucas & Lucas is a perfect combination of engineering, design and creativity. For their series of mirror objects called Jagged Reflection (released in 2016), Lucas & Lucas developed their own technique to create an interplay of light and reflection. Combined with Aptum's expertise and innovation in lighting design, this resulted in a collection of lighting objects that play with the boundaries of what is real and what appears to be a mere reflection.

About APTUM x LUCAS & LUCAS
We are Lucas & Lucas, a Dutch design duo that is inspired by objects and experiences from everyday life. By making interventions in shape, color and material, we create new objects with a minimalist aesthetic, always balancing out functionality, beauty and conceptual depth.
In our studio we also work for various brands, cultural and educational institutions. Through our collaboration, we have a broad expertise in the field of product and graphic design.

The programme is named Silence is the presence of everything. Description: In our contemporary world, where sound pollution is prevalent, 'Silence is the presence of everything' is an immersive installation that invites the visitor to reconnect to earth's natural soundscapes.

Soundsystem for silence

In our contemporary, post-industrial era, the audible impact of human activity is widespread, and places of true silence, undisturbed by sounds that are unrelated to earth’s acoustic system, have become increasingly scarce. We resort to noise-canceling headphones to shield ourselves from the noise pollution we ourselves create. Consequently, we've become disconnected from the natural acoustic environments that once enveloped us.

'Silence is the presence of everything' conjures sounds that emulate those found in nature, with spatial depth and intricate layering. It creates audible worlds that burgeon, transform, and gradually evolve, made possible through a custom built sound system comprising 96 distinct sound sources. It offers a pathway to rekindling our connection with the natural acoustic realm, urging us to listen and reevaluate it with fresh ears.

"Silence isn't the absence of something, but the presence of everything"
- Acoustic ecologist Gordon Hempton

The Cut-out Body is a selection of works that have as a common theme the body: its materiality, its details, its textures, its cultural meanings, and its traumas.

Parentesi Cinema

Parentesi Cinema works with movie session formats and spatial installations to generate a dedicated space where to elevate and appreciate moving images. The project aims to foster an environment conducive to an immersive appreciation of experimental video content.
The installations we design aspire to challenge conventional cinema perceptions, transforming from a static container to an adaptable sanctuary molded by the interplay between content (films) and container (host venue). We believe that effective dissemination of specific moving image materials necessitates the physical space contributing to the overall experience.
Thus, our efforts transcend cinema consumption, evolving into the orchestration of tangible convergence moments, compelling us to invest significant efforts in crafting unique cinematic installations each time.
On this behalf, for DDW 2023 we are pleased to introduce The Cut-out Body, a curated selection of video essays, experimental films, and moving images, made by different international artists, which have as a common theme the body: its materiality, its details, its textures, its cultural meanings, and its traumas.

The cut-out body

We see an infinite number of images of bodies every day on the infinite number of screens that surround us. We are too accustomed to assuming the idea of the body through this format, but: is it really possible to narrate and perceive the body through a screen?
The moving image gives us what a body cannot give us. It partially interprets the body, certainly, but it is in this deliberate and conscious partiality that the beauty lies. The film fixes the image of a body and makes it unalterable, but moving images are also a means of being able to alter the perception of something, they are dynamic by nature, as its very name indicates. They make the body become a fixed image that does not represent the full reality, so it creates a fiction. And it is in this fiction that the body finds a new mobility, a new freedom to narrate itself. The body without a body, that is a projected body, now becomes a body rich in details and in stories. A new corporality. It becomes a specific and, therefore, a more real body.

The programme is named Building The Body Building. The subtitle of the programme is Experience one of the first Dutch multi-functional buildings out of Timber and Hemp and see what it takes to build sustainably and bio-based.. Description: Usually a building is the only visible result of a building process. Yet with housing and climate crises that don't seem to be resolved expeditiously, we like to share our lessons and propose our way to build sustainably, based on a product design approach of pragmatic integration and prototyping.

An product design approach to building sustainably

The Body Building, opened in 2023, features multiples homes, an office, a language school, workshops and a large roof garden, on the grounds of the former gasholders in the center of Eindhoven.

It is the outcome of a six year long process, in which we played a wide variety of roles: as initiator, developer, designer, engineer, builder and finally, as user. Being industrial designers by nature, we got fascinated about building sustainably. As relative newcomers to the world of architecture and construction we learned a lot. Yet we also quickly found out that the building industry proved to be unable to cope with unconventional building principles.

This is why we ended up taking the lead ourselves, applying our innovation design approach to the scale of a building, integrating not just functionality, technique and aesthetics but also reconciling aspects like organisation, finance, usability and the practical execution on-site.

The Body Building is named after all inhabitants doing body-related work, and the building process being a very bodily process.

The timber and hempcrete in the Body Building store over 200 tonnes of CO2 which has been subtracted from the atmosphere.

The programme is named A Bite of Void. Description: Starting from the critical approach on modern excess of positivity, the exhibition brings up a prevailing emotion of the time, 'sense of void.' Each projects grant own shapes and colors to it, allowing audience to contemplate the potholes of one’s life and question what a ‘better future’ truly is.

A Step to Face the Void Beyond the Excess of Positivity

After an era of seemingly endless material production, the graph of economic growth is flattening. Resources are depleting, goods are unstable. As technology advances, industries become more complex, and personal lives change at a rapid pace. Social media, the platform for modern relationships, only allows "likes" and only highlights moments that "look" happy. In the pressures and paradoxes of the times, many individuals seem to be exploiting themselves by chasing tangible accomplishments, the pinnacle of their lives. But to what end? Referring to the modern excess of positivity inherent in over-production, over-mobilization, and over-communication, philosopher Byung-Chul Han warns that violence can come from positivity as well as negativity. Therefore, we take a lingering step to face the void, the meaningless moments after all the achievement and positivity and design a practice of well-being.

Confronting and Digesting Void

How do we face and nurture a sense of emptiness for true well-being that embraces both the positive and negative aspects of life? From the beginning to the end of our existence, we encounter emptiness at one point or another in our lives. However, the shape, color, and frequency of emptiness varies from person to person. Feeling of void arises from the finitude of life, the gap between ideals and reality, wavering faith, or the cyclical nature of existence. In the upcoming exhibitions, artists and designers confront and digest their own kinds of void through writing essays periodically about the self realization of individual void and their relation to the culture we live in. By granting shapes and colors to the impalpable existence, the artists invite audiences to various types and contexts of voids and offer reassuring moments in the sympathy of the time. Through the exhibition, the collective also hopes to introduce the self-inquiring attitude on the cycle of constant affirmation, allowing us to contemplate the potholes of one’s life and therefore question what a ‘better future’ truly is.

About Collective Doh
Collective Doh consists of artists who are interested in permeability of literature in their lives. The members imply the method of essay writing into their design practice. The artists break the pattern of puking a solution-looking answer in front of the great urgencies. Sober observations on individuals’ entangled reality creates perspectives from mundane but mutual questions. The collective takes steps as if writing a non-fiction where the ability to make connections and expression is freed.

The programme is named Facing the hype. Description: GROOVIDO dives into a society characterized by the pressing presence of hype. Exploring the world of luxury streetwear fashion and its connections with that of design, the duo tackles the topic with their new collection of cabinets inspired by collecting and displaying in the “hype beast” culture.

The hype

GROOVIDO has partnered with COEF, a luxury streetwear store, to appropriate its context and create a multidisciplinary exhibition.
As the duo navigates the complex social fabric of modern and digital culture, the concept of hype emerges as a powerful force that permeates our daily lives.
The hype, defined as a marketing strategy where a product is advertised as a must-have item, is considered a central characteristic in the dynamics of modern fashion, due to the insistent influences of social and streaming apps.
This concept has had an impact on the design industry as well, evident through collaborations like IKEA x VIRGIL ABLOH. These partnerships serve as examples of how the influential and culturally significant realms of streetwear and hype-driven fashion are being embraced and integrated into furniture design.

The collection

GROOVIDO decided to explore how the phenomenon of hype is shaping the contemporary design scene, through their new cabinets collection, in which they delve into the intricate interplay between fashion, design, societal trends, and personal identity, inspiring conversations and reflecting on the contemporary culture and its quest for self-expression.
These cabinets, with their open all-round design, are composed of 3 different materials: lacquered wood for the main structure, laser-cut aluminum for the decorations, and, finally, laminated glass for the vitrines. The main characteristic of the furniture pieces is their marked inspiration from collectible figures, with their aluminium decorations taken directly from them which develop throughout the cabinet through a game of solids and voids and flowing into the various vitrines, highlighting and giving importance by adorning what they contain.

About COEF x GROOVIDO
Gianmaria & Giorgio first met in Eindhoven where they both attended the master's degree in Contextual Design at the Design Academy of Eindhoven. In 2020, they joined forces to create GROOVIDO. They don’t define themselves only as designers or artists, but their practice and work are on the verge of both. They believe in the poetry and narrative power of things. Their latest projects are focused on digital culture and its relationship with the physical world.

The programme is named Groter dan je bent. The subtitle of the programme is (EN title transl. 'Bigger than you are')
Can one cherish the innocence of the past, even if it might feel conflicting to look at?. Description: 'Bigger than you are' (OT 'Groter dan je bent') is a hand-drawn animated short film that explores questions about recovery and reframing one’s intimate childhood memories through a hopeful lens.

Tender atmosphere

Delicately animated pencil drawings emerge and evaporate through an associative narrative form. Supported by subtle piano music, ambient sounds and earnest writing, the film creates a gentle atmosphere to explore themes of questioning oneself, one’s past and one’s internal struggles. This entices the viewer to reflect on personal growth through a new lens.

Can one cherish the innocence of the past, even if it might feel conflicting to look at?

Delicate and Subtle

'Bigger Than You Are' strives to innovate and broaden the existing visual language for stories about recovery. As such, the film stays far away from clichéd imagery with lots of dark, scary images. By focusing on universal pieces within human experiences in a delicate and subtle way, it makes a story about recovery accessible to a wide audience.

'Bigger Than You Are' seeks the balance between big and small, strength and vulnerability, volatility and presence, subtlety and clarity.

The programme is named | STEVEN BANKEN |. The subtitle of the programme is inside his workshop: the current collection and new additions.. Description: Explore Steven Banken's workshop, where he presents most of his current collection alongside new additions to the Tannic Acid Series and a new furniture piece.

Tannic Acid

‘Never use steel nails in Oak‘ was the advice of Banken’s grandfather. He was a carpenter and blacksmith and forms the basis of this project. Oak contains high concentrations of tannic acid, which turns dark blue when it’s exposed to steel. The same happens with steel, as a result of a chemical reaction between red iron oxide and tannic acid. To accelerate this normally undesirable process the elements that cause this natural transition are applied in liquid form on the other material.

Tannic Acid series of Steven Banken reveals the exceptional similarity in color of two radically different materials after the natural transition.

I-Joist

Wood has a visible memory. Its surface shows traces of time passing and thus, tells us a story. With the project I-Joist, Steven Banken opens up a new chapter in this story. I-Joist revives the traditional use of joists as a high quality construction material, combining aesthetic appeal and strength. Every joist is registered with a serial number, which tracks down information on age, location and size of the tree from which it is made.

Copper Lamp

A cool led light reflects inside the copper pendant lamp. It creates a clear light center which is surrounded by a warm copper semblance. Walnut parts fits precisely in the ends of the copper tube. The parts are shaped on the same type of machine, the lathe.

The programme consists of an exhibition at Sectie-C with design projects; a workshop programme; and interventions in the main locations of Dutch Design Week.

Why the Body?

The body: this collection of organs wrapped up in skin, filled with fluids, feelings, and sensations. It is our way to experience and respond to our surroundings, to feel and make sense. When you feel something is off, or you wake at night with a rushed heartbeat, your belly aches from witnessing others' suffering, or your back hurts from working behind a laptop for too long. While living in capitalist structures, our bodies have become vehicles for profit, to be optimized for productivity, to be working in order to be efficient and to be quantified so we can fix errors before they occur. Be productive, be active, be beautiful, enhance yourself, walk more, ignore your feelings, keep moving. This beautiful, amazing, wondrous body of ours, capable of experiencing so much joy, excitement, and pleasure—how can we reclaim it?

We all are living and breathing bodies making sense of the world around us. By turning to our collective embodied knowledge and grounding ourselves in our bodies we can find comfort and a sense of security when facing the complex reality around us. With the solid foundation of our bodies, we can restore our capacity to constructively act upon the problems we face.

Why the gym?

We are all familiar with the gym - a place you must visit regularly to stay fit, healthy and forever young. A place where, after a long day of building your career, you can build your body so you can have it all.

For The Body as a Movement, we are creating a different exercise space - a space where we can practice other ways of being in and with our bodies. An environment that helps us to restore our connection to our bodies, accept and celebrate the bodies we have and make them our own again.

Our gym will function as a container of the program of events that will activate it through different formats, abandoning the idea of an exhibition for a space of transformation that is lived in the program's timeframe. The program will consist of the Gym, Workouts and Bootcamps, where our participants and audience can train and rehearse the change.

The program

Our program will consist of the Gym in the space next to restaurant OST in front of The Pool, at Sectie-C. It will be an exhibition of design projects - workout machines and tools - that engage with the body in line with the narrative of The Body is a Movement.

Invited artists will develop workshops - Workouts - specifically for our DDW program. They will be performed in the Gym in different sessions during the 10 days of the program.

During Bootcamps, we take our training outside into the main locations of DDW. Guerrilla exercises will be developed for the specific spots where people gather (the queue of DDW Design Rides, entrance/exit of big exhibitions like the Graduation Show or Klokgebouw).

The programme is named Folding Fever. The subtitle of the programme is Exploring the Limits of Folding Various Materials. Description: As a young creator, I used to employ origami to transform a variety of colored papers into peculiar shapes. Now, having grown into a full-fledged designer, I still retain the urge to engage in crafting. However, how can I incorporate this into my design practice in a professional manner?

From paper to concrete

Folding is a splendid way to swiftly create shapes, yet it remains confined to certain materials. Despite the explicit warnings from ChatGPT, I embarked on a quest to investigate whether concrete (and other materials) could indeed be subjected to folding. This concept is centered around pushing the boundaries of folding as a design technique, with the aspiration of rendering every material ultimately foldable. The experiments stemming from this endeavor offer the potential to unearth novel shapes, structures, and functionalities, while also bestowing a fresh stage upon the joy of creation.

Tinkering or Design

Origami and folding techniques are frequently employed in product design, yet they, in my view, fail to capture the true essence of this crafting technique. Since the beginning, I've been captivated by crafting methods and how I can incorporate them into designs. Presently, exhibitions are often characterized by somber art, devoid of meaningful stories, and ready-made products lacking soul. As a designer, I'm actively seeking techniques and forms that rekindle the joy of creation within me.

Following my project 'Dat kan m'n kleine nichtje ook,' I embarked on a quest to explore more crafting techniques. These crafting methods frequently serve as the foundation of numerous design objects; however, regrettably, this often isn't reflected in the final work. Through my efforts, I aim to provide a platform for this crafting aspect of design to shine.

The programme is named WA(I)ST. The subtitle of the programme is A collection made from clothing that would end up as waste. The clothes in the collection are made in such a way that they fit every waist. Description: In my collection are garments that we often see in our daily life such as: shirts, jeans, jackets.

The garments consist of different materials, shape and color. My collection does not have everyday items of clothing.

Sustainable Fashion

This collection originated from thrown out clothing from the cycle. The items I received are garments that the thrift store could not sell and would be destroyed.
Giving new life to discarded clothing, I try to prevent the waste of these existing materials.

I look at the different elements that the garment has. I then use these elements to shape every outfit, so there is always a different outcome.
The looks are adaptable to different body types. This way there is no need to think about who will be the carrier of the garment and it will be more diverse.

When I create I try to look for shapes in my designs. I usually start with draping on the mannequin and don't know what the end result will be.

I am always looking for some big shapes, playfulness and use of fabrics around any human body. With these tools I am trying to achieve the shape I have in mind.

I never stop looking for, and learning new things. With my graduation collection I learned a lot about what’s important in fashion and how I can change it.

The programme is named Nomi. The subtitle of the programme is Through design research, we explore tangible improvement directions that contribute to modern women's healthcare.. Description: Isn't it strange that one in three women has negative experiences with internal examinations? Nomi is sparking a conversation about the outdated state of women's healthcare. We are driving a movement for improved communication between doctors and patients, ultimately aiming for policy changes.

Design research for a better approach to current women's health care

Nomi is committed to improving women's healthcare by enhancing women's autonomy during internal examinations. Research shows that many women find these examinations embarrassing, painful, or even traumatic. It is crucial for these intimate interactions to occur in an environment where the woman's boundaries and needs are respected by everyone involved.

Nomi has developed guidelines and informational material for both medical professionals, as well as patients, with a focus on equitable communication. Patients require better communication and more attention to their personal boundaries, while physicians strive for efficiency and professionalism. Nomi wants to recognize these needs in order to integrate humanity and understanding into the caregiving experience.

This initiative is not just about raising awareness but also about concrete policy changes within women's healthcare. Nomi seeks to inspire women to assert their boundaries and needs while inviting healthcare providers and policymakers to collaborate on a women's healthcare system where women feel fully respected and supported in their personal healthcare journey.

About Zoë Sluisdom
Nomi aims to provide modern and inclusive women's healthcare, where women experience greater autonomy during internal examinations. It is an initiative of Afdeling Buitengewone Zaken (A/BZ), led by Zoë Sluisdom. A/BZ is a design research studio specializing in societal issues.

The programme is named NATURE X. The subtitle of the programme is What if products are shaped by nature?. Description: My research has led to designs that represent the combination between human creativity and nature with its unique structures. In this development, I show the growth from beginning to ends of a structure, but in the form of a piece of furniture.

Vision

In the purity of nature, we find a wealth of interesting biodiversity and ecosystems that continue to amaze and inspire us. What if we could embrace these wonders of nature and let them serve as the design inspiration behind our products? This question is the basis behind my research into the infinite possibilities of naturally inspired design.

Inspired by the fascinating structures in nature, such as bones, trees, plants and animals, I was guided by the future vision "What if nature could shape our products?" During extensive research into the unique shapes, textures and structures in nature, I was inspired by.

My goal was to push the boundaries of traditional product design and create an interaction between human creativity and the infinite possibilities of nature. I experimented with different techniques, such as sketching, prototyping and material research, to bring new designs to life.

Nature and me

The subject of nature fascinates me greatly because I see many similarities in it with my own life and personality. As a person, I am calm and reliable, always ready to help others and offer support. I believe that nature itself exhibits similar traits. Nature is an infinite source of inspiration that I can strongly relate to. Its beauty, organic forms and ability to renew and grow reflect my own creative process. I see my designs as a reflection of this natural harmony, seeking to capture the essence of the natural world and translate it into tangible designs.

Result

The result of my research are designs that explore the relationship between human creativity and the unique patterns and structures found in nature. My research has resulted in designs that are the combination between human creativity and nature. In this development, I show the growth from beginnings to ends of a structure, but in the form of a piece of furniture.

With this process, I want to show what it would be like if in the future, with advanced technology, we were able to make this a reality.

Let's explore together, inspired by the beauty of nature and driven by the desire to innovate design. Let's push the boundaries, embrace the potential of nature, and create a sustainable and inspiring future for design.

The programme is named Treasuring the unease. Description: Intrigued by objects evoking fear and admiration, Lena D’Hoore fearlessly explores her subconscious, using their tension to light her creative path. With a unique visual language, she unveils hidden beauty from within.

Fearful Fascination

The unconscious mind can be a dark place. Lena D’Hoore embraced her own irrational fears and let it guide her though this journey. Fascinated by different objects, she feared and admired at the same time, she searched for a better understanding of the hidden beauty that revealed itself in front of her eyes. Well aware of the power of the imagination that comes along with the fear, she tried to translate this personal feeling into her own visual language.

Through different techniques she searched for a way to build images that capture the feeling of the overwhelming fascination that she experiences in presence of these objects. By blowing up the micro images that she created, she found a new dimension that reflects this crushing feeling of fear and admiration that is beyond her control. In collaboration with the textile industry Lena could expand her knowledge of the professional field and work a bigger scale while preserving the smaller details in her work. The objects she collected inspired her in an indirect manner to create her own patterns. The resulting images guided her towards the materialisation and/ or function of each piece in this collection.

About Lena D´Hoore
Lena is a Textile Design graduate from LUCA School of Arts. She began her creative journey with a Bachelor's in Jewellery Design at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Antwerp. Further she enriched her skills through a post-graduate in Furniture Design. Her work fuses diverse techniques seamlessly.

The programme is named Ad Terram. Description: Ad Terram rethinks the ritual of ash scattering. Exposed to wind, the earthen urn will erode, allowing the ashes to be gradually absorbed by nature.

-

In contrast to the often confrontational practice of ash scattering, Ad Terram represents a more gradual and dignified ritual. The ashes of the deceased are incorporated into the earthen material which is processed into an urn. The material stays unfired. At the pace of the wind, the urn will erode, slowly releasing the ashes until nothing remains of the urn. 

This way, the forces of nature create a unique scattering process for each deceased person until nothing remains and the body is completely absorbed by nature. Moreover, this slower way of spreading ashes reduces the negative impact of toxins on our soil. The release of the ashes can be regulated, so they are released to the soil in lower concentrations. This way the soil can process the ashes at its own pace and soil life is affected as little as possible.

The programme is named A Fearless City. The subtitle of the programme is Reshaping gender related fear in public space through “empowerment” and “eyes on the street”.. Description: A Fearless City approaches gender-related fear in public space through various design applications.

The aim of the project is to empower and sensitize bystanders to take a proactive role. The designs facilitate conversations and focus on physically taking place in public space.

Collective and social design actions

A Fearless City is a project that approaches gender-based fear in public spaces through various design applications.

The aim of the project is to strengthen the social position of individuals in an urban environment-also known as empowerment. It also aims to sensitize bystanders and activate them to take a proactive role in the city-this is what I refer to as eyes on the street. The resulting designs stem from the central question, "How can collective and social design actions related to gender-based anxiety play a role in the development of alternative visions of public space?"

Within this project, I focus on the one hand on facilitating conversations. The focus in these "Dialogue centered mediations" is on open conversation in which victims of anxiety can share their experience with others who either share this experience or wish to assist them.
On the other hand, this project focuses on physically taking place in public space. The "object centered interventions" attract attention by exploiting the aesthetic nature of design.

Four designs

The principles of empowerment and eyes on the street are translated through four designs:
A creative making workshop addresses the issue and maps personal experiences in an urban environment.

A flag reflects individual experiences on a broader issue.

A rescue chair mobilizes bystanders and symbolizes a sense of safety and visibility. In addition, the chair is adaptively implementable on existing lampposts and women's experiences can be heard via a megaphone.

An intervention in a night store explores its potential as an "urban safe space. A carpet there allies visitors, manager and designer and through its materiality reflects vulnerability and cringe anxiety.

The project contributes to the sensitization of fear in public space while introducing a 'traveling intervention package': a tool for awareness. Finally, this project combines the aesthetic character and social function of design to highlight social issues in the public sphere. They carry signal functions toward a "Fearless City.

The programme is named A Horse With An Attitude. The subtitle of the programme is Queer Kinship As Methodology. Description: A Horse With an Attitude explores the relationship between identity and design through the perspective of the designer’s queer identity.

Description

Based on a participatory trajectory with three queer designers/artists from the designer’s closest queer community, the way in which they appeal to their identity within their creative practice is examined and made tangible. This project sees design as a tool to discuss intangible themes such as the broader conversation about identity and sees the act of design as a language that can facilitate the discussion of difficult themes such as queerness. Conversations about, among other things, group feeling, gender and representation are conducted on the basis of design decisions regarding typology, colour, material and context of use. By documenting the decisions within these conversations and the entire design process in a publication, this knowledge about the personal approach of these participants in relation to identity is made tangible and shareable.

The programme is named Schaduwvragen. The subtitle of the programme is A life project where the shadow is questioned in diverse ways. To understand the shadow, but also time.. Description: Renieke Meyfroot goes looking for her fascination of the shadow. Through the shadow she is going to behold. She tries to question him, to understand him in his formality, mobility, temporality and its meaning. It is a search for time that she can not grasp and understand.

Shadow questions

Shadow questions is a project where there is questions about shadows. By asking these questions, different things come up. Who ensured that the project was continued. For example, the Shadow Questions project brought two phasing together. Shadow and textile work together and bring you a game of movement and questions with view. Who again raises questions and will answer questions. It is a never finite game that has only more clarity through time. Because through time everything will change and move without standing still. In the Shadow Questions project an attempt is made to record these aspects of time. To be able to fix a glimpse of time in time. To question and investigate him.

About Renieke Meyfroot
Renieke Meyfroot has been fascinated by textile since she was small. This has further developed into projects where she is researching textiles and handicraft. Throughout her life a second fascination has come, shadows. Which currently have become a great source of inspiration for her.

The programme is named To Dwell. Description: Lyrical Desire

The places where we get lost are the same places in which we can truly find ourselves. To be somewhere, dwell, as an act in itself, is the most rewarding thing. For Naomi Pols, camping triggers these emotions. It is a lyrical desire for a mobile lifestyle, while living in a sedentary society, dominated by white men. Naomi questions whether humans are made for this sedentary lifestyle, since we all share the heritage of nomads. However, because of overpopulation, overgrazing and many political interferences, not only will her desire never become reality, it also endangers the existing nomad culture today. Therefore the nomads and their textile traditions are at a tipping point.

The programme is named Biloba. Description: BILOBA delves into the captivating realm of the double, exploring the intricate dimension of duality where opposites interweave and objects seem to mirror one another. It centers on celebrating the distinctiveness of imperfection and dispelling the illusion of identicality.

Design Research

This exploration evolves into a rich image archive, where concepts such as the Doppelgänger, Janus, the alter ego, metamorphosis,... are intuitively analyzed and reinterpreted. Gradually, a graphic universe unfolds, dissecting the theme of duality in a new and personal way. Experiments with various materials and textures aim to make these insights and thoughts tangible, in the hope of discovering a deeper truth and inspiring the viewer along the way.

The Chair

The final outcome reveals a thought-provoking Siamese twin: two seemingly identical parts, uncomfortably bound to each other. In their original state, they appear completely indifferent and purposeless. However, their true nature emerges only upon separation. Revealing two unique elements that seamlessly harmonize with one another. Now in state of perfect balance, they rise into an entirely new entity.

The programme is named Forged by Intuition. Description: This research explores the relationship between creative freedom, intuition and design, with a focus on stimulating innovative design styles and methods. The project uses sheet metal processing as a source of inspiration for chair designs, in which intuition and free thinking lead to new forms.

Research into Creative Freedom, Intuition and Design

This research explores new approaches to the interaction between art, design, emotion and design processes. It focuses on promoting free creativity and intuition during design, resulting in an innovative design style and method.

Methodology: An initial catalog of sheet metal working techniques served as a source of inspiration. This catalog led to diverse chair designs, embodying method applications as well as individual reinterpretations.

Creative Freedom and Intuition: Holding on to preconceived ideas inhibits creative expression. A shift to a dynamic, intuitive approach with freedom of thought opened up more room for creativity during the design process.

Evolving Process: Emphasizing intuition and embracing unlimited thinking created an organic design process. This gave rise to a new design style and method, where tools acted as brushes on canvas.

Integration of Art and Design: "Forged by Intuition" emphasizes the value of art-design integration through sheet metal as a canvas for expression. Chair designs symbolize the fusion of intuition and design, showing an evolution in approach.

New Forms of Expression through Intuitive Design Processes

The project shows that letting go of limitations and embracing creativity results in innovative forms of expression. The chairs serve as tangible manifestations of this approach. They illustrate the power of intuition as a source of inspiration for innovative, meaningful designs.

"Forged by Intuition" highlights the fusion of art, design, emotion and intuition. It shows how allowing free creativity leads to a new design style and method. Breaking down barriers creates space for innovation and personal expression. This project emphasizes the crucial role of intuition as an engine for compelling and groundbreaking designs.

The programme is named Peltchair. The subtitle of the programme is Sit down, relax and power the world of the future. Description: The call for climate action echoes louder than ever before. Gather your strength, for within each of us lies the potential to produce power. Power unleashed by, in stillness, sitting on the Peltchair that harnesses the warmth within you to light up the chair and brighten our future.

The Peltchair's power

Casted from copper and aluminium in a nature inspired structure, the Peltchair blends beauty and function to produce power with the body heat of its occupant. As you sit, warmth flows through the chair, making it gently light up. The greater this flow, the brighter the Peltchair will glow.

Though, act swiftly, since the warmth flow depends on the temperature difference between your body and the surrounding air. With Earth’s rising temperature, the Peltchair’s glow will fade, reminding us about our urgent role in the climate crisis. Therefore, take a seat on the Peltchair and reflect on how we can truly contribute to this problem. Hopefully its fading organic glow will help ignite a luminous idea, so together we can shape a better tomorrow.

The programme is named Self-collab-portrait. Description: This work embodies the void between a designer's ideal and reality into tangible creations. Navigating various roles, the designer balances discord between visionary pursuits and livelihood demands. Embracing this dissonance as integral, the collaboration of different professions reflects himself.

Collaborated design by 6 different identities from one

This work is an attempt to reflect the emptiness that comes from the gap between the ideal and reality of the designer into an object. The designer has a variety of jobs across ideals and reality, including a jeweller, designer, welder, carpenter, barber, and construction worker. As a dreamer pursuing an ideal and a labourer for a living at the same time, he underwent the discrepancy from those occupations. He feels never a fulfilling void from this discrepancy and decides to embrace that as a factors constructing him. He knows his previous interests and jobs have been blurred one day and new ones will come up someday. Therefore, he understands his very current status as completed himself. Various occupations at the moment affect his identity and become good hints to understand him.

This work is a self-portrait of himselves, made by collaboration work by all of those professions. The chain-like object reflects the designer’s attitude in dealing with different hierarchies from ideal to reality of the occupations.

The programme is named ME; MI GRAINE & MY ROOM OF PAIN. The subtitle of the programme is How pain transforms into textile design. Description: The textile designer Laura Dieckwisch explores in her master‘s degree collection the possibilities of navigating the design process from physical limitations.
On view is a collection of knitted, three-dimensional fabrics created in collaboration with the TextielMuseum Tilburg.

From pain to fabric

The textile designer Laura Dieckwisch presents her graduation project from University of Applied Sciences Hamburg. Her fabric collection explores the theme of migraine, a prevalent neurological disorder causing severe pain, by utilizing design as a medium for discussion. Laura Dieckwisch incorporates her own chronic migraine into an intuitive design process by allowing the pain to have a significant impact on the design. As a result the fabric transcends its traditional role, metamorphosing into an object, a space, and a companion.
Throughout her work the designer intricately weaves the tensions between touching and being touched. Her aspiration is to conceive textiles that kindle a desire for physical contact and emotional closeness. Her fabrics strive not only to be visually captivating but also to offer a singularly tactile and sensory experience. Emphasizing durability, these meticulously crafted fabrics are intended to be enduring companions, accompanying their owners throughout the passage of lifetime.

About Laura Dieckwisch
As a visionary textile designer Laura Dieckwisch perpetually exploring new dimensions within textile surfaces. Her artistic endeavors are grounded in two fundamental elements: lines born from meditative drawings, as the shaping foundation of her designs, and threads as the building blocks for tense and tactile textures. The fusion of these elements empowers her to craft haptic textiles endowed with almost sculptural qualities. She also explores the possibilities of material collages..

The programme is named Echoes. Description: An exhibition that delves into the heterogeneous origination of a series of one-off, collectable design pieces. Inspired by a diverse selection of materials cherished within the designer's studio over the years, the project resonates with a journey of memory, connection, and continuity.

~

At the heart of the showcase are fragments of the designer's reminiscences that touch on past and present interpersonal relations. The exhibition is a testament to the allure of these collected resources, celebrating their transformation into design pieces as tangible echoes.

Emerging from the studio's atmosphere, the displayed collection embodies the designer's commitment to the stories treasured within these materials. Just as an echo completes a sound wave, the exhibition brings the loop to a close by inviting viewers to reflect on the inherent significance of materials, origins and continuation.

The programme is named Icons Re/Outfitted. The subtitle of the programme is The Visionary Lab teams up with Vitra and Levi’s®: designers upcycle iconic chairs with discarded denim, inviting you to take a seat and rethink waste. Description: In an era with growing mountains of textile waste, we embark on an exploration of innovative solutions to repurpose discarded denim. 'Icons Re/Outfitted' is a transformative journey, breathing new life into iconic chairs from Vitra (e.g Eames, Panton and Nelson) with repurposed denim from Levi’s®.

Icon meets Icon

Initiated by The Visionary Lab, this project delves into the intersection of fashion and furniture, uniting iconic design-chairs with equally iconic denim, complemented by talented designers who treat the chairs as their muse. Nkwo Onwuka, Hannah Brabon, Kelly Konings, Tim Dekkers, Sophie Cagniart, Norman Monsanto, Barbara Polderman and Sarmite Polakova were invited to re-outfit design masterpieces by Vitra with bold new looks crafted from discarded denim. The outcome is a captivating series of artful chairs which demonstrate a diverse spectrum of innovative techniques and time-honored crafts.

A Fashion Eye on Furniture

For instance, Tim Dekkers ingeniously transformed the iconic Coconut Chair by George Nelson using felt made from discarded denim, produced by the social factory I-Did. Similarly, Nigerian designer Nkwo Onwuka masterfully reimagined the distinctive Amoebe chair by Verner Panton, seamlessly blending a contemporary approach to upcycling with the rich tapestry of traditional African craftsmanship. Additionally, Sophie Cagniart revived the Plywood Group LCW Chair by Charles & Ray Eames with vintage pairs of Levi's® 501® jeans, paying homage to the 150th anniversary of this iconic denim. Using traditional Japanese embroidery techniques, Cagniart breathed new life into the denim and the chair, imbuing it with a fresh tactile experience and a renewed fashionable allure.

The Art of Change

The upcycled and transformed chairs transcend mere functionality, weaving narratives of heritage, innovation and sustainability. They not only encourage reflection but also inspire a shift towards change, as each unique piece tells an universal message: waste isn’t waste until you waste it. Ultimately, ‘Icons Re/Outfitted’ forms an artful ode to craftsmanship and our planet's well-being, demonstrating the possibilities of end-of-life denim for both the fashion- and interior industries.

The programme is named Six And A Half Feet Up And Down. The subtitle of the programme is Joiner Jan Gerritsen lets us talk about life and embrace death, within our home, by designing a coffin that joins its owner on its life journey.. Description: As life progresses and you arrive at a different phase, the coffin's use can be altered to match your needs. The coffin is designed to be used as a book cabinet, a couch, or a storage box.

In addition to presenting this project, Jan will give workshops in planing wood.

Life's journey

Using the coffin throughout your life and giving it a prominent place in your house breaks the taboo of death. Transforming something abstract that is always there into something tangible. It will be a tool to open up conversations about death between the owner of the coffin and the visitors to its house.

During Dutch Design Week, the goal is to talk about life and the end, that's how to live. Every product made by mankind is also a similar process to our lives: concept, design, production use, and some changes because of wear. During the use, you will change with the object.

Joiner Jan Gerritsen

Decades in the craft. Theoretical education, extensive knowledge in a broad field. Constantly developing oneself while expanding expertise and creating practical tools, furniture, repairs, restorations, and woodworking.

I hold great respect for all materials. The tree grows, yielding good wood, at least a century old. It's a marvel how we, as humans, have developed materials like metal and glass.

I handle materials with utmost consciousness, more so than with myself, out of respect. Beyond mere ownership, consider the producer and think of the tree. When you know the material and engage with it consciously, you discover its hidden qualities and beauty. Take wood, for instance, its grain. You turn the piece around to reveal its true essence—an unexpected outcome—the sense of wonder.

Where there’s water, there’s a way

Under the auspices of social design studio Cocosmos, Dommel Vibes programme participants research urgent issues concerning water in the city. How can we incorporate more green areas and water in a growing city? Which contradictory interests do we need to resolve? How can we unify major diverging interests like the economy and climate, urban densification and quality of life, biodiversity and recreation? What role can the Dommel play here, now and in the future?

Issues that benefit a social design approach: they demand collaboration and innovative solutions from different perspectives. From residents, industry and the Water Board. The objective is to increase awareness and create support, facilitating the harmonious existence of contradictory wishes.

In-depth programme

Eindhoven municipality invites students, various experts and stakeholders to participate in an in-depth programme. In a series of sessions, expertly managed by social designers from Cocosmos, they collaborate on involving the Dommel in the urban environment. A component of the (Dutch-spoken) sessions is open to the public. Register online via the DDW website. The link will be provided soon.

The programme is named Octopus Vulgaris Stealthy Skin Suit. The subtitle of the programme is Soft -Robotic and Lenticular Print Bodymasks mimicking the transformative qualities of octopus skin. Description: Together with TU Delft and their Crossing Parralels program artist Mette Sterre develops The Octopus Suit as a result of research into the transformative capabilities of an Octopus (skin), creating a hybrid beings, that dissolves the boundaries between mind body, human and non-human.

Octopus Love

The octopus skin suits from Mette Sterre researches how the transformative qualities of octopus skin can be mimicked and made wearable in an ongoing research using soft robotics and lenticular printing techniques.
Her fascination started when night diving and saw the incredible transformative powers of the octopus; not only changing colours, but also changing shape to blend in its surroundings, she fall instantly in love.
This was the starting point to create a series of carnivalesque bodymasks, combing new technologies with hand made aesthetics.
By using generative design tools, lasercutting, soft robotics, perspex, 3d and lenticular printing, colour changing liquid chambers, pneumatics to create a serie of new octopus-human hybrids.

About Mette Sterre Enterprise
Mette Sterre is a designer and visual artist based in Amsterdam. She creates sculptural body masks that cover the wearer’s entire body. She mixes digital techniques with carnivalesque and DIY aesthetics to create complex body masks. These restrict and permit movement forming the basis of her performance work. Sterre investigates how the human contour can be disturbed in the broadest sense, both ideologically and materially, in order to question what more we can be, beyond being human.

The programme is named We Never Change. Description: In a series of five painted, ceramic vases, Nonna Hoogland links Greek myths and mythological themes to the present.

Greek mythology

‘We Never Change’ is a reappraisal of Greek mythology. In a series of five painted, ceramic vases, Nonna Hoogland links Greek myths and mythological themes to the present. The vases are based on Ancient Greek pottery and the renaissance served as an inspiration for the paintings. By mirroring the portrayal of profoundly human themes in Greek mythology to our modern-day society, Nonna explores the shifting norms and values concerning these themes and concludes that human nature doesn’t change.

About Nonna Hoogland
Illustration has always been my way of processing and understanding myself, and the world around me. That's why emotions, ethics, history and human nature have always been the main subjects of my work. My work can be poetic, cynical, humorous or intimate, but it's always brutally honest. I've recently discovered ceramics, which has expanded the ways I am able to tell my stories.

The programme is named The Symbiocene Forest - Down to Earth. Description: 'Symbiocene Forest-Down to Earth' shows an ongoing journey of projects by inspiring creators investigating the Symbiocene. They invite us to explore a new world where human activity, art and the natural world converge harmoniously, creating a balanced world where we seamlessly integrate with nature.

The Symbiocene

The exhibition ‘Symbiocene Forest - Down to Earth’ shows the ongoing artistic research and projects of talented makers and designers that explore the Symbiocene. Talented participants explore aesthetic, innovative and ethico-political matters by incorporating science and technology with art and design. In that process, they are encouraged to rethink society’s attitude towards the interconnected world around us, regardless if it's visible or invisible to our eyes. They look at existing systems, connections and language with a nonhuman perspective and develop ideas that spark a discussion on societal, ethical and existential issues. As such, the exhibition’s goal is to inspire the public to look at our world around us from a more ‘Down to Earth’ perspective.

The programme is named How to hope to be. The subtitle of the programme is An exploration in biobased building together with the community. Description: Designer Catinca Tilea is exploring what it would be like if everybody could build with organic waste. Visitors of BioArt Laboratories are invited to grow a bio-brick. This social project explores how biotech could be used by communities to help rethink our relationship with the natural world.

Organic waste from your home = a building material

Household organic waste serves as a substrate for mycelium forming. This becomes a solid material that can be used to build with. Designer Catinca Tilea invites the audience to make bio-bricks, exploring how, why and what people could build with this material. The bio-bricks visitors grow during Dutch Design Week will be later assembled into an outdoors construction, on the terrain of BioArt Laboratories. People are invited to witness or partake into this experiment, getting a glimpse of how organic waste could be used in a resourceful way.

More community involvement in sustainable practices

The key feature in building with organic waste is that people would do it themselves in their neighbourhoods. Such a practice could considerably reduce the amounts of waste that we all create. It could also educate and make people reflect upon the current lifestyles we lead. The proposal is to use this biotechnique at the heart of community to empower people to help in a way that is meaningful to their surroundings.

We too are part of the ecosystem

We can no longer go on the same way we did so far. Our anthropocentric culture is slowly crumbling down our own 'habitat'. With her social experiment, designer Catinca Tilea proposes to enable existing knowledge of biotech as a social tool. This could help make the cultural shift we need so that we may understand that we too are part of nature.

The programme is named 3Phase House, a Project of Sustainable Re-Homing. The subtitle of the programme is Purposeful place-making and collective empowerment through design.. Description: This rural Armenia family dwelling design is aligned with a government initiative for development outside the capital. Strategized in 3 phases due to the loan disbursement, the design aims to invigorate surroundings as it emerges from the land, fostering harmony between occupants and ecosystem.

Re-Homing Brief

An Armenian family residing in Lebanon asked us to design their new home on a modest and derelict agricultural plot in Armenia as a re-homing project. The plot is located in a small town, 30mins away from the capital. The project falls under a government initiative that offers construction loans to promote development outside of the capital Yerevan, addressing rising real estate costs and urban density in the city centre.
The retired couple sought an affordable multi-generational home, prioritizing practicality and functionality. Bringing the land back to life and harvesting it was a significant aspect of the project brief, as the client anticipated moving onto the property to plant food.

3Phase House

Due to the phased distribution of the government loan and the limited budget, we strategically designed the house to be built in 3 distinct chapters, hence its name, 3-Phase House. The objective was to ensure that the house is functional and livable at each stage of the construction process, with the house telling its construction story both in materiality and spatial arrangement.
As the house grows out of the land, the land in itself is re-infused with life.

The Design Process of a Project of Sustainable re-Homing

The design approach prioritizes sensitivity, kindness, and attentiveness to the site and future occupants, maximizing the humane and environmental potential of architecture. With the user experience as the focal point, this project strives to provide a spacious, comfortable, caring environment, extending generosity to both users and the surrounding ecosystem.
This presentation showcases the ongoing design process of the house, which began 2 years ago. The goal is to share the journey of designing this house: a process of purposeful place-making, and lasting, collective empowerment through design.

The subtitle of the programme is A selection of the best circular products made from waste from the recycling centre Upcycle Centrum Almere.. Description: At Dump Design you can witness our research on the development of new materials, made from recycle waste. These practical examples will inspire you. Circuit boards transformed into jewelry, sofas turned into bags, or flooring repurposed as tables, new design is possible where you don't expect it.

Dump Design

The recycling center serves as the dumping ground for all consumer waste. Could there not be a solution to all this garbage constantly piling up? Despite past efforts by a multitude of ad hoc solutions, no structural approach has ever been found. This year, Dump Design, a collective of 6 designers, has initiated a research product design project to address this problem at the Almere waste recycling centres. We aim to provide a solution, by systematically creating a design portfolio exquisitely from waste.

Once materials are thrown away they are considered worthless and ugly. This makes a waste recycling centre the antithesis of design. We recreate the vibe of a waste recycling centre and contrast by showing the products in class, design and aesthetic

Too much waste to handle

While collaborating at the Upcyclecentrum in Almere, we were confronted with the staggering volumes of "waste" brought in daily. Among the discarded items, we discovered valuable electric chairs worth 1500 euros, entire flooring worth approximately 6000 euros, and countless bags filled with t-shirts and underwear.

Each of us focuses on a specific aspect of the waste stream: textiles, furniture, metals, or electronics. Our collective aims to prompt visitors to reflect upon their disposal habits and the significance of their discarded possessions. By combining expertises, we strive to raise awareness among a wider audience about the thoughtlessness with which items are discarded. While at the same time showing optimism with the value and esthetics of the products. With our ultimate goal to shift consumers' perspective towards more conscious purchasing and discarding practices.

The programme is named The Kitchen: space of connections. The subtitle of the programme is A system of kitchen units informed by assembly and usability. Description: Zerogloss kitchen combines an easy-to-assemble and minimal material system with an understated aesthetic, inspired by a sense of simple living, both in style and usability. A kitchen that naturally connects to relationships, functions and spaces of daily life with an intimate, human attitude.

The kitchen system

The series is based on a system that assures an efficient and responsible use of resources, a simple assembly process and flat packaging. Two steel frames, one front and one back, are connected through a series of brackets with a double function of structural fastening and support of storage elements and appliances. Using only mechanical fixings for every component, the system avoids the use of chipboard inner panels and any kind of glue. We made it simple to assemble and disassemble to potentially replace a worn-out piece or move the entire kitchen in a new house and to allow an effective separation and recycling of each part at the end of its lifespan.
Zerogloss kitchen range includes a series of low units and columns that can be arranged in different configurations with drawers, cabinets and appliances. We strive to create a design rooted in simplicity, clarity, and functionality that stands in the living space with sobriety, and ease, yet retains its nomadic and distinctive identity.

About Zerogloss
Zerogloss is a design and manufacturing studio committed to creating highly functional and carefully crafted pieces through honest materials and subtle interventions. We focus on smaller spaces and modular, transportable structures in our search for a reversible process, where the product can be easily disassembled, relocated and recycled and the materials endlessly reused. Working in our own workshop and in collaboration with local manufacturers, we try to take care of our land and community.

The programme is named BIRNE. Description: BIRNE is a line of porcelain objects by ceramist Massimo Pavan.
The aesthetics aims at a meticulous repetition of lines and simple forms in limited pieces and variations.
A quiet reflection on simplicity and deep attention to details distinguish his practice. Each piece is wheel-thrown.

Understanding the process

The process is of fundamental importance in Massimo’s work.
Working with such a delicate material such as porcelain requires precision in each stage of the making, from throwing to firing.
The essential qualities of the final product are hopefully a mean to draw attention back to the process.

About Massimo Pavan
Massimo Pavan is a ceramist.

His practice splits in two main directions. One of a more artistic and research intent.
The other functional and more commercial, yet of a very small and quality production, which was developed a little more than a year ago, named BIRNE.

Every aspect of his activity, from designing, to making and selling is personally taken care of.. The participants involved in BIRNE are: Joy of Work.

The programme is named A playful, adaptable furniture system. Description: NINETY represents our commitment to locally sourced, adaptable furniture that provides the consumer with the option to interchange modular furniture pieces between varying styled collections.

Honest in design

Simplicity is at the essence of each design. Every table is configured of four identical parts, manufactured using one process, adapting to interior space in several different ways. Each modular piece is cut from 4mm sheet aluminium, bent along two lines using an automated press brake, and finished either in a coloured powder coat, or a sandblasted texture. Each piece is fixed together using thumb screws, preventing the consumer from having to reach to their tool cupboard.

Whether it’s creating funky aesthetic shapes, functional forms that integrate into a room, or keeping it minimal and doing nothing at all. Our goal is to provide boundless choice for users to customise their personal spaces.

Complex in tolerances

The Geometric Collection is the first collection we have produced. Partnering with a metal work factory in Volendam, to help finesse the production of a system that is perceived as simple. Ensuring each individual part of the table is produced at an incredibly accurate tolerance is essential for assembly, which has proved to be difficult, but we have just produced our first batch hot off the press (brake)

Circularity in Aluminium

We design with the intent to last. For planned longevity, not obsolescence. Adaptability, configuration, and customisation collectively create a stimulated user and ensure our aesthetic outlasts trends and fads. If a part becomes defect, it can be returned to us to be replaced with the consumer still owning a functioning table. However, if all else fails, Aluminium is a completely circular material and can be melted down and formed back without losing any mass or material properties. Allowing the cycle to repeat.

The programme is named Ooooh. The subtitle of the programme is A towel with possibilities. Description: "Ooooh" is made of 100% organic terry, and comes in three charming color combinations.
Like any ordinary towel, it has four corners. But only “Ooooh" has a shapely hole in each corner.
This small difference turns "ooooh" into a bag, a towel for the deck chair...

Space-saving and multifunctional

The holes also function as hangers.
No matter whether coat hook, branch or door handle, “Ooooh" can be casually hung anywhere. It is space-saving, multifunctional and a handy household aid: for example, as a laundry basket set. It was originally created by designers Jan Dobmaier and Vincenz Warnke for exactly this purpose. The “Ooooh” is produced in limited edition in Turkey, certified according to BCI.
It is cuddly soft, 80 x 140 cm and washable at 40 degrees.

The programme is named PIANI - circular, light, convertible. The subtitle of the programme is PIANI is a clearly designed storage space, sustainable and made for the future in circularity.. Description: BFGF Design Studios developed a shelf system made of mono-materials that does not require the usual panel materials. PIANI is made of solid wood and designed to easily dis- and reassemble. The countless customization options with circular designed inserts ensure long-term, even timeless use.

CIRCULAR

The shelf system is made entirely of untreated ash wood, except for the easily removable metal feet. Since solid wood is a valuable resource, thin yet extremely sturdy slats are deliberately incorporated. Due to the well thought-out plug-in system, the shelf manages without a single screw.

LIGHT

Easy to assemble and disassemble, as well as to transport, the shelf also impresses with its delicate and shapely appearance and easy handling with a very good stability.

CONVERTIBLE > OPEN FOR NEW RESOURCES

The changeability lies in the clear separation of frame and inserts. The inserts, in turn, can be easily exchanged according to the respective life situation. In just a few steps, the bookcase becomes a kitchen shelf or a sideboard and is thus durable and open for all individual uses.

About BFGF Design Studios
BFGF Design Studios are thinking spaces and objects in relation to people for almost 25 years. Humour and a culture to debate are a integral part of our way of working. That's what makes us and our company, that's what connects us. We have always been concerned with sustainability because we believe that only companies that are intelligent and forward-thinking in their use of materials and natural resources will survive in the marketplace. More design - less waste | Sustainability is progress.

The programme is named Fietsenrek (voorheen Syntactic). The subtitle of the programme is I exhibit work at 2 locations, at Piet Hein Eek (#1) and Messmerizing (#2). Both pointing to each other and both consisting of jewelery and furniture.. Description: I consider myself an artist who also started working as a designer. The formal art-language found its way into the design discipline in the form of furniture and accessories. This year, in addition to the presentations, I will also interpret my working method, concept and visual language from autism

The title 'Bicycle rack (formerly named Syntactic)'

My working method, concept and visual language suit me and come from my own 'visual culture'. The visual culture of people with autism.

This influence also applies to the naming; titles are direct, intuitive and associative. Despite the fact that for myself and in communication with goldsmith Stefan Witjes, we consistently called it 'the bicycle rack', the title became Syntactic. Syntactic was a compromise. Although 'bicycle rack' is very 'Dutch', my experience was that such titles do not necessarily receive a good response. As if it devalues my work.

From now on, my working method will be communicated as it is. The method is valid, explainable and belongs to me. New found liberty allows me to investigate what I do with that freedom, and where it will lead. For example, what influence has language had on visual language and its development?

I often work without a plan or concept. I'll see what it will become later, forms emerge from that (which I find logical) and I use that to make autonomous images, furniture, accessories and now jewelry. The (wrong) associative thinking, the solution-oriented approach make what could otherwise be an obstacle, fun. That's my motivation.

Bicycle rack (formerly named Syntactic) #1 at Piet Hein Eek

I present the bicycle rack jewelry at the Piet Hein Eek location. The basic form of this originated from a sketch design for a bicycle rack at the Wallhouse #2 in Groningen. The shape is a rearrangement of the ribs of a cube.

The shape accidentally ended up in jewelery due to unfamiliarity with goldsmithing. I had technical questions about the hanger/line 'Tante Greetje' (#2). I wanted to investigate and visualize these bottlenecks through geometric objects instead of putting them into words. One of these objects was 'The bicycle rack' and this is how this new collection was created.

Barstools (six variations) from a new line of furniture are also on display. The stools arose from a personal wish, namely to be able to sit dynamically. Compare it to a climbing frame. The barstools are presented in raw form, an unfinished state. I have come to love the rough version and it also gives viewers the space to fill in the finishing themselves. I am very curious about other peoples' thoughts.

Bike rack (formerly named Syntactic) #2 at Messmerizing

The original idea was to do 1 presentation, when I ran into a 'problem' during registration: the accountability behind the work. No theme or drive other than the creative process itself in this collection. Of course I take things like sustainability into account, but that has nothing to do with the form of the work itself. The only thing I could throw into the mix was how autism expresses itself in my work in concept (none), working method and visual language. Something went 'wrong' there, so I added a 2nd presentation, to show how I work on the basis of various works.

Jewelery 'Tante Greetje' is a private assignment where the shape is a derivative of my autonomous works 'Kubieken'. The piece of jewelery is made of 18K gold that has been sandblasted. My first jewel in precious metal. Jewelery positions itself in a very free field; it is design with more freedom than art. Although subject to gravity, the objects hang freely, there is not necessarily a top or bottom.

At Messmerizing you will also find an example of how my shapes are recycled. In the 'Bicycle rack' coffee table, the shapes of the jewelery presented at Piet Hein Eek have been incorporated into a piece of furniture.

The programme is named LINO UNDERCOVER. The subtitle of the programme is The Hidden Side of Linoleum. Description: Linoleum is traditional yet perfectly contemporary: natural and sustainable, easy to maintain, and tough as nails. This DDW, the material breaks free from its well-known image and sheds its familiar reputation. With Lino Undercover, Tarkett and Studio RENS uncover the hidden facets of linoleum.

Unconventional experiments

For over 125 years, Tarkett has been producing linoleum following the same original recipe. Constantly evolving and searching for new applications and possibilities, the flooring brand initiated this collaboration with Studio RENS. Designers renowned for their unconventional color and material experiments, and researchers that have been propelling businesses and quality labels forward for more than 15 years.

From the other side

What if down is up, and back is front? If the invisible becomes visible and the frayed edges take center stage? When material qualities are allowed to speak for themselves and it's not the finish but the start that takes the spotlight? During DDW, Tarkett and Studio RENS showcase what a unique collaboration can lead to, presenting discoveries you wouldn't have imagined. Research findings, applications, and product concepts that hold great promise for the future.

Pure, but exactly different

Stripping, slicing, dissecting, reversing, fitting together and colouring: Lino Undercover is a revealing exhibition featuring three new spatial applications in the lead role. Pure linoleum, of course, but exactly different from what we're accustomed to (only its natural scent remains).

The programme is named Embassy of Food. Description: The Embassy of Food believes in the role that designers can play in shaping the world behind our food and the relationship we all have with our food.

The farm of the future

By changing how we handle our food—how it’s grown, transported, and consumed—we can significantly improve the planet and society. However, this is not an easy task. It requires a broad food transition, the convergence of expertise, and cross-sectoral collaboration. It’s a challenging journey. Designers use imagination to find new perspectives when everything else seems stuck. How can we offer new perspectives to reshape the current food system?

In the coming years, the Embassy of Food will build a network of food experts consisting of designers, farmers, policymakers, businesses, producers, and scientists. Together, we will explore new perspectives on how we approach our food. This year, we begin with the farm of the future as our central theme. The goal is to create a sustainable and viable food system that benefits everyone. What would this farm look like if we take sustainability, animal welfare, and health as our starting points? How can we design a food system where different cycles are closed and we optimally utilise all resources? And how do we shape the transformation of our landscape with current transitions in mind? What does this mean for the land, the farmer, and the supply chain?

The Embassy of Food challenges the network to reflect on the current food system. How can we look at the world behind the food on our plates differently? Can we use imagination to break free from our individual ideas about the existing food chain and collectively challenge the status quo? And as a network, can we accelerate the transition by offering new perspectives for the farm of the future?

The Embassy serves as a place where the network can come together throughout the year to develop various scenarios for the food chain of the future. The way we handle our food can trigger a broader transition. The food transition is not only about what we eat but also about improving biodiversity and ensuring the availability of healthy and nutritious food for everyone. What is your role in this bigger story?

The programme is named Bra+ve: Versatile Recovery Wear for Breast Cancer. The subtitle of the programme is Bra+ve is a postoperative bra designed for breast cancer patients to provide comfort and a positive experience during recovery.. Description: One in nine women have breast cancer procedures. Current rehabilitation products remain overlooked and outdated. Bra+ve results from a two-year practice-based design project in Aotearoa (New Zealand), exploring innovative 3D knit technology and a user-centred co-design process.

The Starting Point

In 2016, my godmother, in The Netherlands, had a breast cancer procedure. The aspect that troubled her the most was the "uncomfortable and unattractive" postoperative bra she was required to wear for a whole year after her procedure. She described it as "ugly and uncomfortable," making her feel terrible during a time when she needed comfort and support the most.

These bras, predominantly functional, lack aesthetic considerations, resulting in limited style choices, visible outlines under clothing, and restricted colour palettes. Moreover, their fixed designs offer minimal adjustability, failing to cater to individual preferences.

Most postoperative bras are constructed from synthetic, plastic-based materials, emphasising compression but neglecting extended wear comfort. Prolonged wear can lead to discomfort and potential adverse reactions. Witnessing my godmother's experience ignited this project and the drive to improve the care available to women like her.

Bra+ve aims to integrate comfort, adjustability, and aesthetic appeal to empower patients during recovery, supporting not only physical healing but also emotional well-being.

Collaboration & User Research

The core value of this design is patient-centricity, putting patient needs at the forefront of design and innovation. Bra+ve results from interactions with over 140 patients, eight healthcare specialists and four lingerie designers.

Following a co-design process throughout research and development, this project emphasised continued primary user feedback to ensure the design developed best meets user needs.

The Breast Cancer Foundation NZ and Cancer Society were an integral part of gathering data. These insights were synthesised through surveys, interviews, design reviews and user testing into product-based solutions. These interactions have provided opportunities for original insights to cultivate design innovation and development.

"You've lost your breast, and then they want to put you in those God-awful contraptions. I'm at that stage where I'm frustrated and have stopped looking."

Interdisciplinary Design Processes

This practice-based design project highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary design incorporating fashion, textiles, and industrial design processes to create a more personalised and effective solution that addresses the complex needs of the user group—combining innovative technologies, 3D body scanning, 3D knitting, 3D printing, and wearable technology, alongside specialised CAD software.

Bra+ve is crafted using sustainable, antimicrobial materials using innovative 3D knit technology. Bra+ve's adjustable compression inserts, strategically placed to target areas affected by lymphedema, provide a massaging effect on the skin and increase overall comfort and adaptability during recovery.

The addition of front fasteners enhances independence, making it easier to use, especially for those with limited hand mobility. The unique cross-over shape allows each cup size to be controlled separately, accommodating uneven breast tissue. Through its antimicrobial materials, innovative 3D knit technology, magnetic fasteners, cross-over shape and adjustable compression inserts, Bra+ve delivers a versatile product that fits you and your needs without compromising your daily life.

- Annika Maas : Cool Flow
And others.

A wearable Artificial womb - Nine de Wit

For nine months my mother carried me in her belly. It's hard to imagine how this may be in the emerging reality, where artificial wombs could fundamentally alter how humans reproduce. An artificial womb is an experimental instrument, that can facilitate pregnancy outside the human body. This instrument replaces the womb as an organ.

Something an artificial womb lacks to create, is the prenatal bonding between carrier and fetus. This attachment is very important for the psychological and emotional development of a human being. If the human factor, the biological mother, is taken away during the pregnancy, what does this mean for the development of the fetus?

Does it make us human beings only if developed inside a human womb? The beat of a human heart, the tone of a human voice, the movement of the body or a touch, it might be a combination of all of these elements.

Within this work you may communicate with the fetus by touching the wearable artificial womb. The pads on the wearing person's body are connected to touch sensors in the belly, through the umbilical cord. The motors inside the pads cause vibrations to be released, a back and forth interaction.

Annika Maas - Cool Flow

Imagine that it's summer, you are feeling hot. And you can wear a jacket that's cooling you down. Cool Flow is a concept for a jacket that has a completely intergrated cooling system, thats runs on water.

Now that the are summers getting hotter, I wondered if you could create a jacket that keeps you cool and is enjoyable to wear. It's desigend to function independently without the use of a freezer or the adition of adding bottle of water to the jacket.

The jacket is constructed in layers, the first of which includes a water system with a cotton circuit and water bags.

The system shows you how warm the water in your jacket is when paired with Arduino. The exterior of the jacket serves as the second layer. With a screen to show you how cool the water is and it' s waterproof. To prevent water from leaking out.

It is appropriate for wearing to the beach, a park, or a theme park.

The programme is named Remembering by Feeling. The subtitle of the programme is An exploratory journey into the intricate dance between memory, tactile sensation, and the interplay of light.. Description: I am always curious about the connection between the perceptual experience of touching and the awareness that emerges within our bodies. How do these experiences constitute memories and, moreover, shape our imagination and understanding of reality?

Touching the light

"Remembering by Feeling" is a light and textile sculpture installation. Waving and embodying optical fibers into textiles, the illumination installation responds to delicate changes in the viewer's body — temperature and movement, seemingly tracing the contour of memory and time.

Here, light is, therefore, a visualization of the momentary emotions, our inner states, which imitates the fleeting transience of our perception of emotions and feelings over time.

Textile and the lost memory of skin

Skin, a sentient organ, holds profound recollections, tracing the contours of memory and the ebb of time through the language of body temperature and the intimacy of touch. The use of soft textiles is, therefore, a deliberate choice serving as a poignant metaphor, reminiscent of skin—the intricate vessel of perception and remembrance.

The fabric sculptures are an embodiment of tactile record, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in a multisensory journey that transcends the realms of imagination and connects deeply with the essence of feeling and remembering. The twisted and crumpled texture symbolizes the metamorphosis within us as we navigate over time.

The poetics of touch

With an embrace of light and materiality, the installation initiates a dialogue with the viewers. As viewers interact with it, the fabrics respond to their touches, fostering a profound connection between physical and emotional. The gentle play of light on the skin enhances the interplay between bodily memory and sensory stimuli, thereby reinforcing memory formation and the perception of reality.

As engagement with the sculptures begins, the soft textiles respond to touches, creating a symphony of sensations that underpins the memory and the perception of reality. Within this tactile encounter, the touch of light upon the skin orchestrates a harmonious fusion of the physical and emotional, inviting exploration into the nuances of remembrance and imagination.

The programme is named Union of the Irreconcilables. The subtitle of the programme is Wool+Algae. Description: Union of the irreconcilables is a project that explores what it means to create from within. The space was used to understand and give expression to my experiencing periods of derealisation, using the medium of the deeply intentional and durational approach to textile work that I practice.

Shape+Form

The setting of the work is in the post-mortem, pre-natal nothingness, where I meet and use several characters and objects. I translated my experience into a fairytale, told not through words but through music, bodily movement, lights and textile works. I learn my lesson in the nothingness and find my way back into the womb, to be reborn.
The medium used is textile crafted from raw wool working+algae leather. The pieces help me to give shape to the tales that need physical expression. What's central in my work is the care for the entire process of creation, each step carefully passed through, my hands being the carriers of transformation. Raw, dirty wool becomes delicate and durable products. My work is a form of resistance; a slow resistance against the toxic fashion production system. It is a call for care, understanding the products we use, and knowing how they can improve our lives.
I use performance to be present at the art creation stage. Artworks are a kind of memory, looking back at when the art happened. Performance art is more current. I am distanced from the audience yet I am there, close enough to hear my breath yet too far to feel my touch.

About Roze Paars
Roze is a newly graduated(BA) textile designer. Her focus has been storytelling through using biodegradable textiles of algae combined with raw wool working: locally sourcing, washing, carding, spinning, felting, knitting, and other specialized techniques that lead to assembly of an object or garment. Currently a biology student, she strives to have her projects stretch over a range of artistic/academic disciplines, imbuing a positive impact and/or awareness, both conceptually and physically.

The programme is named WISKUNDIGE KUNST en DESIGN door LAURENTIUS LAB.. The subtitle of the programme is Fashion Tech meets Math Art. Description: Witness this unique merging of fashion technology with geometry, calculus and humour. New textile production methods go hand in hand with playful mathematics. Did you know that certain weaving patterns follow the logic of Escher's prints? That new fractals are being invented every day?

Stretch fabric meets Knot Theory

The "Textile Borromean Seifert Surfaces" have not been shown in The Netherlands. DDW has the scoop.

Tessellation meets fashion

The "Dancing Houndstooth" comic was selected for the challenge of the International Day of Mathematics (Pi day 2023).

Complex numbers meet houndtooth

The "Friends of Mandelbrot" artworks are based on equations similar to those of the most famous fractal. Squaring complex numbers leads to squaring a Pacman or a houndstooth tile.

The programme is named Reflections to reflections. The subtitle of the programme is Lucerne School of Art and Design. Description: Project outcomes from a six week workshop
Led by Michiel Martens from Studio Martens & Visser

Reflections Revealed

A reflection is a beam of light or sound that’s
comes from an object. It is a diffracted radiation of
something. Reflections can been seen as a glow, a
reverberation of light or a gleam of color.
A reflection needs a source of light, darkness,
materials, it plays with surfaces and the observer.
You could say reflections are about interactions
between you, objects, materials and light. A play
between physical space, non-space and matter.
Reflections in the broadest sense of the word, less
physical and more philosophical; reflections are
about contemplation, it gives us distance, time to
think and to object or reject. A reflection makes us
able to see something from another perspective,
in another perspective. Reflecting yourself, your
habits, your mind, or even the world.

Discover the world of reflections through the eyes of eight talented students. Showcasing their unique perspectives on this expansive theme. Over four weeks, these students have delved into the diverse facets of reflection, using various mediums to express their visions.

The programme is named In the Works. The subtitle of the programme is A collection of experiments from the workshop of Atelier Max Lipsey.. Description: Atelier Max Lipsey is showing some furniture experiments, in various stages of completion, from his workshop in the collaborative space de GRRRage.

The Workshop

The workshop, where things are made and materials are manipulated, can be frustrating, dangerous and expensive. Tools break, it's noisy, dusty and everything is heavy. Often things don't go as planned. But, maybe because of these circumstances, it can be a great place of spontaneity, experiment, and inspiration. For my work, there are ideas I would never find behind a computer screen. I have to go wrestle them out of the materials. There are also mistakes, wasted time, and a lot of learning. I hope to show a selection of all of these alongside some new projects in progress.

About Atelier Max Lipsey
Atelier Max Lipsey is the workshop of Max Lipsey, an American designer based in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. Max's work follows his own fascinations with nature, material, craft, history, and making…and translating these fascinations into an object. He strives to find more authentic, vital and surprising ideas.

There is no blueprint to redesign our nature-inclusive world in a more sustainable way. And because of the global entanglement between people, animals, plants and objects the task is extremely complex. We live together. With everything and everyone we share origins, circumstances and climatic future. Moreover, we are increasingly realising that we have to get beyond the parasitic Anthropocene. The way we live together, produce and consume must radically change. But how?

Appealing examples are needed to accelerate the process of transformation. Hopeful examples, ones that are able to inspire as many as possible, in small or large steps, to create a movement. Design is a fascinating instrument to create such examples because it touches everyone’s life: literally everything around us — in our daily life and in society — has been designed. From their wonder, translation and imagination, designers enable the conversation about our future. It is important to spark their ideas, experiments, successes and failures and to share these with as many people as possible. And that is exactly what Kazerne does.

To accelerate the transformation process, appealing examples are needed. Hopeful examples, which in small or larger steps can inspire as many people as possible to start a movement. Design is a fascinating tool to create these because it touches everyone's life up close: literally everything around us is designed, in our daily lives and in society. From their wonder, translation and imagination, designers enable the conversation about our future. It is important to drive their ideas, experiments, successes and failures and share them with as many people as possible. And that is exactly what Kazerne is doing.

About Group Exhibition, curated by Annemoon Geurts
In the heart of Eindhoven, Kazerne Foundation provides a daily platform to the sustainable impact of the design field. Here, yearly about 100,000 visitors experience the power of over 100 leading creators, start-ups alongside established ones, in an inviting hospitality environment, where slowing down is allowed, should be even, to start the conversation about the impact of design on everyone's life.

The programme is named From flooring to furniture. The subtitle of the programme is Studio Heinepein supports circularity by transforming local hardwood waste streams into designer furniture.. Description: My goal is to gently nudge people toward circular thinking and behavior. I do this by creating circular products where circularity is subtly visible and, at the same time, completes the story.

The necessity of change

After my studies, I realized that I didn't pay much attention to material choice in my school projects. However, this changed during my first few months at the Upcycle Center in Almere. Here, I work in one of the three ateliers where I can create new products from the waste of residents living in that city.

Working here every day, I am confronted with the amount of waste people throw away, and I truly see how significant the problem actually is. For example, I came across a thrown-out hardwood walnut floor of about 80 square meters. I was shocked both by the material's value in euros and the ignorance of the person who discarded it.

About Henk Toetenel
I am Henk Toetenel, 22 years old, and I have been trained as a Creative Craftsman at Cibap in Zwolle. My passion for making furniture started back in the day in my grandfather's garage. Currently, I have my own business where I transform reclaimed wood into designer furniture in an innovative way.

The programme is named DUMP DESIGN: SIGNIFICANT LEATHER. The subtitle of the programme is SIGNIFICANT LEATHER is honest, rough and no frills, nothing more, nothing less. Everything and everyone has value and significance.. Description: SIGNIFICANT LEATHER shows two identical bags in the same material and color scheme. They have had the same function before that both were labeled as waste.
A significant difference is who sat on it and what social position these bench sitters had. But is that seen by everyone?

DUMP DESIGN: SIGNIFICANT LEATHER

SIGNIFICANT LEATHER has a raw design in all simplicity. This design is about the origin of the materials, because the design is the same. SIGNIFICANT LEATHER is about origin, exclusion and seeing the value of products, materials and people.

A bag is made from a leather sofa where famous people have sat, where adoration and placing on a pedestal are important. What is looked up to.

The other bag is made from a leather sofa from a youth home. A place where young people without a safe home situation can retreat. Young people who are perceived as difficult by the society in which they find themselves.

both are equal, have the same function, are made from the same raw material. But you can only guess the origin and nobody can see by eye how much you have to carry.

This edition of Dutch Design Week marks the starting point of a new collaboration in the Dutch furniture industry. Six renowned furniture companies, all producing in the Netherlands, are taking joint responsibility to achieve an ambitious goal: making our living environment more sustainable. Arco, CS Rugs, Gelderland, Label van den Berg, Lande Family and Leolux are teaming up openly to find solutions to the complex issues all brands face. Transparency and cooperation are essential in this search.

Turnaround

Sustainability is a broad concept that becomes concrete for these six brands in many different ways. Examples include guaranteeing and verifying the origin of materials and the generation and responsible use of energy. But also local production, short chains and an eye for the quality of materials and labour. In all these disciplines, sustainability is no longer a 'nice to have' but an essential factor. And now that these companies are opening their doors to each other and to the public, the transparency and willpower to shape the turnaround that is needed are emerging together.

Cross-generational

The companies in this collaboration have often been around for decades; sometimes even more than a hundred years. Craftsmanship and innovation have brought them where they are today. The future always consisted of the next generation. But today's problems call for a look beyond. That is why the six companies are embarking on this collaboration. But there is also a role for other stakeholders. Consumers, suppliers, governments, knowledge institutes and anyone else who can serve the greater cause are invited to follow this journey together.

The programme is named Roadmap to circularity. The subtitle of the programme is Everything you use becomes waste. Nothing we can do about it. What we can do something about what we do with the waste.. Description: Everything you use eventually becomes waste. There's nothing you can do about that. But we can change how we deal with that. In fact, everyone is obligated to do something about it: Netherlands must be 50% circular by 2030. That means that 50% of everything you use should find a next life.

Make money from your throwaways

We are The Bin. We ensure that you earn money from your waste stream. How? By thinking logically. We map out large waste streams from companies, searching for value. We turn your production chain inside out and see if we can introduce discarded products to the market in a new way. In their entirety, in parts, or as raw materials.

Because a product that no longer works for you can be very valuable to others. This way, you earn money from what you discard.

How?

There's only one way to find out: research. Based on your question, we examine all the ins and outs of your waste stream. We analyze your product, identify the pain points, and discover where the undiscovered value lies. Based on that research, we provide you with a thorough analysis so you know where you stand and what the possibilities are.

Don't expect a 'beautifully worded vision' from us.
We'd rather give you an Excel document.

Next, we leverage our network. We identify which partners can help you in your production chain, create samples for a potential new product, and take the first steps in setting up a new chain.

About Martijn ten Kate
It's time for some trash talking. We are The Bin, and we make sure you earn money on your waste. How? With logic. We delve deep into your product chain and see how your waste can be returned to the market. As a product as a whole, a material or as raw material.

The programme is named New Store. Description: Imagine a shop where being a consumer helps, rather than harms, the environment. Nieuwe Instituut presents New Store to rethink the concept of the ‘product’ and explore alternative forms of exchange. The first New Store pop-up opens its doors during DDW, at the Residency for the People in Eindhoven.

New Store pop-up at Dutch Design Week 2023

In this first New Store pilot, we will test forms of consumption and invite visitors to try out regenerative products – products that not only reduce environmental damage, that could potentially reverse it. This is the first phase of a multi-year project, in which the Nieuwe Instituut is collaborating with the International Architecture Biennale Rotterdam (IABR) and research consultancy The Seeking State. Together, we will explore how retail can make a positive contribution to environmental and social processes in the long term.

During Dutch Design Week, three selected designers will test product ideas that rethink conventional consumer products by using alternative materials, production processes, working conditions, sales methods and eventual reuse. This ‘non-extractive’ way of working, which avoids extraction, exploitation and depletion, is the first step in a longer journey. The path to regeneration runs from the current status quo of exploitation, through restoration and conservation, and ultimately to improvement.

The aim of the New Store is to work towards this improvement by testing and implementing new practices, projects and exchanges. What will this look like? Nieuwe Instituut calls on designers and creatives to think along in designing products, stores and exchanges in a different way.

The products presented in this first trial of the New Store were selected from the responses to an open call earlier this year. With the Eindhoven pop-up, the Nieuwe Instituut offers the selected designers a kind of testing room where consumers can try out the prototypes. After its debut at Dutch Design Week, a second, expanded New Store will follow at the Salone del Mobile in Milan in 2024. In the longer term, the lessons learned from these experiments in regenerative design and retailing will hopefully come together in a physical New Store at the Nieuwe Instituut in Rotterdam.

The programme is named Beetle Convicted After Spruce Found Dead. The subtitle of the programme is North Rhine-Westphalia - Defective judgement in case of the biggest biological loss of forest in Germany. Description: Germany witnesses the greatest biological loss of forests in history. It is said to be caused by the overpopulated bark beetle. However, climate change, planting of spruce monocultures, war reparations, political decisions and eventually human neglect and ignorance have all played a major part.

Spruce tree as commercial artefact

Visiting my grandparents close to Cologne, I was observing and capturing the forest catastrophe from a young age on. Over the years, the green landscape turned light brown. And today, it turned into kilometre-long spruce log piles. It is said to be caused by the overpopulated bark beetle. However, climate change, planting of spruce monocultures, war reparations, political decisions and eventually human neglect and ignorance have all played a major part. The forest was transformed into a factory with the tree being the product - a product prone to diseases and natural events, such as the bark beetle infestation. To give an idea of the scale, the commercialised spruce tree is by far the most used and thus the most important wood in Europe.

Spruce tree as political issue

The history falls decades back into the time after WW2, when Germany had to pay war reparations. Cologne is located in the west of Germany, which is a former British zone. The British cut down forests in the western part of Germany to cover their wood shortage, which the newspaper article header Mehr Holz für England (more wood for England) stresses. This falls back to the political agreements made at the Yalta Crimea Conference in 1945 by the "Big Three”.

Since Germany’s economy was down, fast revenues were needed. Growing fast and densely, the spruce tree seemed like a wooden saviour to grow Germany out of its misery. But because many men died in war or were still prisoners of war, women were pulled to the front to clean debris and reforest the robbed land stripes in geometrically arranged spruce monocultures, each with a distance of 75 cm, identical with the sculptural arrangement on the wall. Later on, the women were called culture or debris women and were acknowledged on a 50 pfennig coin, equivalent to their hourly rate, when the new currency in Germany was introduced in 1948. The two-step aluminium casts turn negative space positive and are evidence of today's condition.

Spruce tree as global seal

The three yellow protruding container seals on the wall with the signatures of the "Big Three" (Stalin, Roosevelt, Churchill) symbolise the decisions made on which the forest dieback is based. The heap of seals below them stands for the shipping of the beetle wood. Because around 80% of the spruce is packed in containers and sent for export. More than 50% of it goes to China, where it is processed and shipped back. The reason: the industrial effort to adapt the machines to the new mass of logs is too great. The ventilation tubes on the wooden pallet represent the commercialised tree trunk. The bark beetle trace under the pallet shows the prevalence as well as the utility of the wood, which is the essence of this catastrophe.

About De Fabriek
In the midst of the distorted relationship between man and nature, I follow the branch of development on the non-human side. My work allows me to change perspective and find a voice in these happenings. I feel the urge and responsibility to educate and raise awareness about the destruction of ecosystems by humankind. From the investigation and critical observation of the environment, I seek out the complexity of scenarios and guide the audience through an informed narrative.

The programme is named Design approach for social transitions. The subtitle of the programme is Turning complex change into something understandable by experimenting in policy implementation.. Description: The Netherlands faces societal challenges that impact everyday life. How do you turn a complex change into a social transition (understandable and accessible)? At Klokgebouw we present the lessons learned from two years of a design approach with the city of Rotterdam within the energy transition.

Why a design approach in transitions?

A transition is a long-term process full of uncertainties. There is not only one solution for this. There are often major differences between residents and the system. Residents are expected to change their behavior. Not everyone has the ability to change (at the same pace ). Thereby, many residents are not directly concerned with the topics of the transitions. It is therefore important to understand the perception of residents. A design approach helps bridge these worlds step by step. It is not about designing the "perfect" intervention. But it is about learning from experimenting and thereby achieving social and effective implementation of policies.

By experimenting you learn what the process needs. This approach involves alternating between understanding the context of residents and the broader context of the system in which a transition. A design approach contributes to coping with the uncertainties and complexities of transitions.

Designing interventions for transition processes - Four lessons from the neighborhood Reyeroord

Reyeroord (neighborhood in Rotterdam) must be free of natural gas by 2035. This is a big step for both the municipality and the residents. To ensure mutual understanding around this big change, all kinds of interventions were designed and tested for two years, such as street-talks, red objects out on the streets and an outdoor cinema. This is how we learned how to bring this transition that is far away from residents to something understandable and accessible.

At Klokgebouw we present the intervention 'Red Objects'. The three objects were on the streets for the past two years to make the energy transition visible to residents and with the aim of letting residents experience that something is about to happen. During DDW 2023, we will show what lessons we as a team have learned from this design approach. Using the intervention Red Objects, we will take you through these lessons learned:

1. Make the bridge to the local context;
2. Design with and within the organization;
3. Dare to review whether the approach is effective;
4. Activate behavior in stages.

Getting started with a design approach for your transition? Sign up for our seminar!

In addition to the exhibition at Klokgebouw, we will host a seminar on Thursday afternoon, October 26. During the seminar we will show how, as a policymaker or policy implementer, using a design approach, to translate abstract concepts into concrete results using a design approach. In order to actively involve residents in issues such as energy transition.
During the workshop we will work on how to design resident-focused interventions and how to measure their impact. Furthermore, we will take you through the importance of collaboration between the municipality and designers and how to integrate the design approach into the organizational structure so that it creates sustainable change.

The programme is named BuitenOM. The subtitle of the programme is Seeing the full potential of waste, using craftsmanship to turn it into powerful new products.. Description: With craftsmanship and an unconventional eye, Eversom turns mountains of rejected fire hoses into powerful design. This time, designer Ilse Evers goes beyond exclusive bags and does justice to the fire hoses in amazing interior objects. Also great for outdoors.

Observe with a twist

Eversom is about seeing potential/possibilities - also in the limitations - and embracing them. From her background in location theatre, Ilse is trained to think outside the box. This way of observing, combined with craftsmanship, results in a surprisingly diverse and high-quality range of products and objects, made from discarded fire hoses. From monumental carpet to fragile folding screen, from classic chair to robust lamp, from detailed bag to cheerful gadget.

DaarOM

The name Eversom is a twist of the words Evers and andersom; to turn around. The product names are catchy dutch wordplays. They invite you to observe differently and even turn your ideas about life upside down once in a while. Names like OMkopen, “bribe” for the shopper and OMkleden “undress” for the carpets not only make you smile, but remind you sometimes you need to turn your view to see the full potential also in everyday life.

Far from being extinguished

Eversom makes sustainable products from old fire hoses whose usefulness are far from being extinguished. They were used by the Dutch Fire Department to douse countless fires and save lives. As soon as those fire hoses are discarded, they end up on the rubbish heap, unless reclaimed by Eversom. The heroic material cannot be recycled, but it is ideal for reuse. Ilse developed her own tools in order to be able to handle this robust material. It’s like teatherworking with a twist. A labor-intensive process resulting in: Timeless design with a heroic story and 100% vegan!

The programme is named The New Old, Objects for use.. The subtitle of the programme is Re-establishing the connection between an object and its user. Shining light on deprecated heritage by creating new objects for use.. Description: In the present era, we often disconnect from the objects and implements that surround us. Amidst the rapid pace of life and the industrially driven world we inhabit, we inadvertently overlook the artistry, the knowledge of materials, and the heritage woven into our everyday objects.

An homage to craftsmanship and tradition.

The exhibition serves as a heartfelt tribute to the art of craftsmanship and the rich legacy it carries. Four designers and artisans, deeply connected to the essence of the workshop, employ a fusion of conventional and innovative techniques to forge objects intended for practical use. The diverse methodologies embraced by each creator result in an intriguing assortment of pieces that converge within this exhibition's realm.

Within the walls of their studio they nurture their living and working environment. They are diving into heritage and aim to translate its old qualities into new objects and tools by making use of traditional and non-traditional techniques.

Open studio and exhibition.

As a collaborative group of 4 they organize an Open Studio and presenting the exhibition: ‘The new old: Objects for Use’. Through this exhibition, the group aims to cast a spotlight on narratives that have faded into obscurity, with the ultimate goal of greater comprehension and a more profound bond with our possessions. By doing so, they aspire to enhance the experiences of those who engage with these objects, resulting in richer interactions for their users. The exhibition showcases a varied mix of functional pieces, including knives, footwear, furniture, and even an ingenious furnace unit that delves into the art of cooking over an open flame.

Verkstan.

The collective is composed of the minds of: Tom Schoonhoven, Ben van Kemenade, Ruben Warnshuis, and Vasco Verissimo. Their combined body of work consists of a wide array of materials, ranging from wood, steel, and stone to textiles and more. Brought together by their shared passion for time-honored craftsmanship and an unwavering fascination with methods, they have joined forces with a common purpose.

The backdrop for this exposition is none other than the creators' own workshop, aptly named "Verkstan." The workshop consists of two areas: a common workshop for machinery and a space where each of the makers has their dedicated spot within which they express their unique perspectives and crafting techniques.

The programme is named Why product design matters. The subtitle of the programme is An ode to the craftsmanship of product designers.. Description: With the Vij5 collection, we cherish the craftsmanship of product designers; we think this profession should be cherished and would like to tell you more about it in our DDW23 exhibition at the Hallenweg in Eindhoven!

Significant added value

The craft of the product designer is so much more than coming up with a nice idea or beautiful shape. This year during DDW we will show how good product designers in 2023 can provide significant added value in various ways and broaden our horizons through their designs.

A process for change

As DDW nicely describes it: “Innovation, aesthetics and beauty are compelling ways to open the door to meaning, mobilise people, and break through paralysis. Designers are experts in formulating and visualising alternative perspectives, enabling them to take people on a process for change.”

Understanding the added value of product designers

Divided over a number of relevant themes, we present various new products in our expo and we tell the vision of the designer behínd the product, so that you will better understand the added value of product designers.

About Vij5
At Vij5 we publish a collection of interior accessories, lighting, and furniture. As ‘publishers of design products’ our work is content-driven, prioritizing the product and the story behind it. We act as a platform for designers and makers by developing, making, and distributing new designs together. Our aim is to create a positive impact on the people around us by playing an essential linking role. With the Vij5 collection, we cherish the craftsmanship of product designers.

The programme is named Salta Heat House: Harvesting Extreme Heat. The subtitle of the programme is Extreme Heat for Regenerative Living. Description: An underground haven in Salta, Argentina, ingeniously utilizing excess heat for self-sustaining systems, paired with resource-efficient agriculture and a pioneering "heathouse." With Argentina's record-breaking heatwaves and dire crop losses, we embark on a mission to redefine survival.

Resilient Sustainability

Navigating heat, wildfire, and drought, our project pioneers responsive sustainability, fusing ancient wisdom and tech innovation. Amid economic fragility, our self-sufficient vision thrives through local materials, thermoelectric energy, and water-wise farming. A beacon of hope, shaping Argentina's resilient future.

AI's Creative Synergy

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into image generation offers a captivating realm where human creativity and technological tools converge. Illustrated through a visionary project addressing Argentina's challenges, this fusion transforms abstract ideas into vivid visuals, seamlessly harmonizing nostalgia and innovation. While exemplifying a symbiotic relationship between human inspiration and AI-enabled realization, this pioneering endeavor not only produces evocative imagery but also sparks a broader dialogue on the synergy between artistic expression and technological augmentation, redefining the contours of imaginative exploration.

The programme is named What if Lab: Rethinking shared space. The subtitle of the programme is What if… we transform shared space into sustainable mixed-use areas?. Description: A future-proof living and working environment requires integral and adaptive solutions. Within that we have to make choices. Especially in spaces where different functions such as industry, people and mobility come together.

Sweco Design Challenge

Together with the Dutch Design Foundation, Sweco is organizing the What if Lab for the third time. In this lab we challenge designers to develop a groundbreaking application for the spatial, social and digital domain. This year, Space&Matter, Starling Studio and Cocosmos have the opportunity to bring innovative ideas to the table together with the experts from Sweco.

Pressure on shared space is increasing

The challenge this year revolves around shared space because it is limited and the pressure on the available space is increasing. In the city centre, in the rural area and in the places where the two meet.

Solutions

This makes it necessary to look at spatial structures, design and use in a different way. Think of places where things are chafing now, where industry opposes living, mobility opposes quality of life or nature opposes agriculture. The designers have come up with solutions for how functions in these areas can be mixed together in a positive and future-proof way.

The selected designers will have access to Sweco's knowledge and network. In addition, they will take the stage during the Dutch Design Week 2023.

About Sweco | What If Lab

The programme is named Embassy of Health. The subtitle of the programme is How can we put health first in our society by utilising the power of design?. Description: Can we see our health as a value in itself? How can we save health, let it flow, exchange and share it with each other? How can design and imagination contribute to a (re)valuation of health as our greatest good?

Health as an interaction

Healthcare costs, insurance premiums, risk calculations. We are used to thinking about our health and care in a very economical way. In terms of money, payments, hard cash, currency also known as valuta. The word valuta can be traced back to the Latin ‘valēre’. That meant something like ‘being healthy or strong’. With that meaning in mind, the Embassy of Health: can we see our health as a value in itself?

We agree: health is difficult to quantify in monetary terms. It goes beyond simple transactions, and it stands or falls with connections. With the relationships between people and their environment, both physical and social. Health has a social foundation: from the safety net of people you can turn to for company or a helping hand, to the guarantee of clean air, regardless of where your house is located.

Health first

We endorse the importance of preventive health. Prevention is better than cure, but we only get started with our health once health problems occur. Will we get there with an apple and 10,000 steps a day in an environment full of temptations, pollution, loneliness and stress? Health inequalities are increasing due to pressure on social security, and health increasingly depends on where you live and what you have to spend. Is it possible to put health first in this fast-paced, modern world? To train our long-term thinking and make investments today for the future? To share in the health benefits now and in the future?

Health as a flow and as a new currency

Care is purchased, insured, performed, documented and invoiced. In the meantime, more and more healthcare providers succumb to the towering administrative pressure and the lack of human touch. The entire healthcare system is coming to a standstill due to our ageing population, backlogs and staff shortages. How do we get that system moving again and let health flow? How can we place people back at the centre and make care move flexibly with their needs? How do we care for healthcare professionals? And what is needed to enable them to fulfil their calling which is to provide attentive care.

In the Embassy of Health, we create space to do things differently. We bring together designers, healthcare providers, citizens, local community organisations, hospitals, welfare authorities, data scientists and policymakers and work with new approaches towards health. We can question the system by adopting a design attitude, visualising promising concepts, and testing alternative routes. This way, we can collectively learn and build on the revaluation of health together. A revaluation that revolves around healthy incentives, where health comes first and is accessible to society as a whole.

Description: Chthulu is a speculative design project that imagine a range of beauty products from 2035: each product is designed to counter a specific anthropocene threat, from antibiotic resistance to biodiversity collapse to extreme heat waves.

Beauty for anthropocene

Chthulu is a speculative beauty brand. It convokes and subverts the codes and trends of the beauty industry to highlight upcoming threats from anthropocene, along with new desirable solutions to adapt - reconnecting our bodies with what’s living and our extended ecosystems, from bees to bacteria.

This speculative design project turns future-defining structural drivers, wowing possibilities in sciences and technologies and emerging uses into radical artifacts : 5 imaginary beauty products designed for extreme times.

The very name Chthulu is a reference to Donna Harraway's Chthulucene, an epoch beyond anthropocene in which the human and nonhuman are inextricably linked.

The future in a bottle

Our speculative beauty range includes 5 products, each one being designed around a specific anthropocene threat.

Second Chance is a sprayable second skin, designed to perfectly protect and hydrate skin in times of extreme heat waves, wildfires or floods, adapting in real time to exterior conditions, especially the levels of radiation, UV and SO2.

Caring Utopia is a fragrance supplement, designed for antiobiotic resistance, where each spraying spreads microbial volatiles that acts as antimicrobials and modulators.

Lands of biome are extreme biome extracts, designed to enhance immunity in times of pandemics, enriching your microbiome with extremophyte bacteria to super charge the collective holobiont.

Future Particles is a regenerative mascara, fighting against biodiversity collapse. Each blinking disperses micro-encapsulated fungal spores beneficial for honey bee workers, increasing their longevity and power.

Witchelium is a device that grows an edited and personalized Reishi out of mail clippings, body hair and sweat, turning human waste into holistic probiotics.

The programme is named Something For Society. The subtitle of the programme is Students show how collaboration, research, design and technology can contribute to a sustainable and inclusive society.. Description: Students of Fontys Venlo Industrial Design Engineering (IPO and IDE) transform societal challenges into creative and realistic solutions. Something for Society provides an insight into this process.

Solutions for Society

Special about the study programme is that the students work on real life challenges from companies or institutions in a design studio setting. The challenges are always of today, so that the students are working with the latest insights and technologies. Evaluating mistakes and celebrating successes are important parts of the study.

Many of the projects are in line with the Fontys for Society theme. We show a selection of these projects, such as:
- an innovative smart pillow to improve the lives of people with dementia (client SMITH Advies & Consultancy)
- a white cane for the blind and visually impaired to improve road safety
- a smart ball to increase inclusiveness and participation in sports at school for blind and visually impaired children (client Visio)
- a rotating climbing wall for teenagers living in Hout-Blerick, to generate energy
- an air purifier based on efficient and smart technology

Both students and teachers will be present to demonstrate prototypes or to discuss opportunities for collaboration.

Active for Society

During the DDW, these students also use their creative, technical and social skills to come up with solutions that the client can use. Would you like to see how IPO and IDE students create these solutions? Do you want to be a client? Visit the Schellens Fabriek!

Tour for Society

The Fontys for Society mission is fulfilled in different ways by the various study programmes and knowledge centers: from care to social design to applied technology. To give DDW visitors an idea of the assignments, programmes, challenges and possibilities, Fontys is organising a Tour for Society.
On Tuesday 24 and Thursday 26 October, a tour will be organised along various Fontys participants in the DDW.
Interested in the tour? Keep an eye on the DDW website!

The programme is named Intelligentie Ontleed. The subtitle of the programme is Waag Futurelab broadens your perspective on intelligence: what our artificial and natural intelligences are and why we need all of them.. Description: Step into the Futuredome and get amazed by intelligence. Whilst we are in the midst of an artificial intelligence revolution, Waag Futurelab's technology dissectors ask the question: how smart is AI really? Come and experience what other intelligences we need to collectively shape our future.

Is AI really that smart?

We are in the midst of an artificial intelligence revolution. It’s being said that AI is better than humans at anything and therefore, it poses an existential threat. Waag Futurelab's technology dissectors took these assumptions and went to work with them. Is AI really that smart after all?

'Computers are perfectly suited for pattern recognition in large amounts of data, but not for decision-making processes and deliberations that determine people's lives. For this, we are in need of other forms of intelligence,' as Waag director Marleen Stikker wrote in De Groene Amsterdammer this summer.

Step into the Future Dome and discover Other Intelligence. From natural to collective to physical intelligence: in this exhibition, we will broaden your perspective on what intelligence is and why we need all kinds of intelligence for the future. Every day, Waag experts, artists and speakers delve into one specific form of intelligence during mini-lectures in the dome.

'We have started to think like computers ourselves, and we are starting to lose sight of things that cannot be calculated,' said artist-philosopher James Bridle during his State of the Internet lecture at Waag. Time for a new understanding of intelligence!

The programme is named Roots collection. The subtitle of the programme is A collection result of a research that develops through experimentation. Description: This collection It consists of multiple series of objects for the habitat. The chandeliers are handmade with ceramics extrusions, silicone modelling, plastics recycling, raffia weaving, metal casting and led light connections.

The Kundalini Chandeliers

A set of neuro-vascular connections, crossed by a living, powerful and ancient energy that permeates the surface of these sentient beings. Everything is connected and everything listens, everything is body and brain.
At the heart of the artwork lies a bronze rope, crafted through the intricate process of lost wax casting. Bronze, known for its durability and resilience, is a noble material with a rich history that speaks to its ability to withstand the test of time. Around the rope a twisting root unfolds encircling a series of ceramic and rattan segments that pulsate with dynamic energy and luminous light.

Raices Flotantes-Floating Roots

The work revolve around the idea that we are shaped by the objects around us just as much as we shape them.
It reminds us how our roots have the ability to float and find life and nutrients in many different soils, adapting to different environments, just like plants do.

Hidden Roots

is a contemplation and reflection on the moment in which one becomes aware of a difficulty.
Is the crystallization of a problem before it is solved, a look at its wonderful aspects, how it ripples the surface of one’s thoughts hiding and manifesting at the same time. Everything is asymmetric and irregular, unpredictable.

About Mida-lab

The programme is named The Sidequest Rave. The subtitle of the programme is Everyone has their own sound.. Description: "The Sidequest Rave" is an interactive sound installation where differences and limitations lead to danceable musical outbursts. In this experience, the audience becomes the artists. Join in and celebrate diversity!

A musical adventure for everyone

"The Sidequest Rave" is a fusion of technology, music, and design, with the audience as the main subject. Visitors are invited to interact with three intuitively designed music machines. Even without musical experience, you can explore and create sounds and rhythms. With immediate feedback from each instrument, you learn as you go. And the best part? You don't just make music alone; you do it in harmony with others. Here, every interaction becomes a unique musical tale.

Limitation in creativity.

It's a paradox: creativity thrives within limitations. They seem to counteract each other, but in reality, it's often within these boundaries that real innovation and novelty emerge. This paradox, where limitations ignite the spark of creativity, is the driving force behind "The Sidequest Rave". The music machines, intuitively designed, are a testimony to this philosophy. Inspired by the simplicity and allure of arcade games, they invite exploration and experimentation. The interfaces avoid the overwhelming complexity of traditional instruments, encouraging even musical newcomers to find their creative voice. It's not just about the technology, but creating a human experience that celebrates playfulness, discovery, and unity.

From neurodiversity to creative harmony .

Jan-Willem Otto is an artist whose artistic approach has been nurtured by his unique youth. He grew up in a neurodiverse family where each child had its unique challenges. From an early age, they learned to live and understand one another. This gave Jan-Willem an intuitive skill and desire to connect various people, forming the foundation of his artistic approach.

From creating computer games to studies in electronic generative music, he's always sought ways to link technology, creativity, and humanity. His early experiences developing educational programs for neurodiverse youths and integrating art and technology in education for students with special needs taught him the power of creativity in forging connections. These journeys inspired 'The Sidequest Rave', an artwork where differences and limitations are not merely accepted but celebrated.

The programme is named Design Interventions and Boundary Artefacts. The subtitle of the programme is We are flooded and washed away by the inevitable reality that our ecosystem is collapsing. Can we turn that tide?. Description: An overview of long-term research projects and methodologies aimed at upgrading organic materials and local production. Through Design Research, Tjeerd Veenhoven develops new value chains that enable sustainable consumption and contribute to the recovery of our ecosystem.

Long-term researches in upgrading organic materials and local production.

In his studio in Groningen, Tjeerd Veenhoven works on the development of sustainable value chains based on local organic materials. These are long-term projects and cover a wide variety of materials, techniques, sectors and products. At DDW2023, Tjeerd Veenhoven will present five research projects in various stages of development, with attention being paid to the material, the value chain, the stakeholders, the technology, the creative process, and the method of research.

The title of the exhibition is "The Watershed Moment" and refers to the moment when the dike breaks and the flooding becomes unstoppable. The title reflects the defeated feeling we all know as we are constantly confronted with the damage we are doing to our ecosystem. And perhaps the tide can no longer be turned, but we should certainly try, with lightning speed, a holistic vision, but also with a perhaps somewhat naive positivity.

In the exhibition, Tjeerd presents projects about peat moss, cattails, tulips, fungi and various other organic raw materials. Some outcomes are already on the market, others are speculative.

The programme is named Deze Beams. The subtitle of the programme is DEZE BEAMS are perhaps the most sustainable product in the world, with which everyone can also get started.. Description: The world is in need of change. We need to consume more sustainably, recycle more, upcycle more and generally use fewer materials. More and more people are aware of this. With DEZE BEAMS we want to help people to offer more sustainable solutions.

Online platform

We are going to set up an online platform where we sell DEZE BEAMS and also bring together a community of designers and future users to inspire each other with the different possibilities of the product. The collaborations with local designers provide the eccentric look that we are looking for with DEZE BEAMS. These high-quality collaborations and the use of residual materials create an endless range of new products that are accessible to the rest of the world.

The programme is named Dicro Lamp. The subtitle of the programme is Simple and visually light, the Dicro lamp attracts attention whether it's turned on or off.. Description: Dicro is a decorative lamp, designed to create a unique and appealing atmosphere through the combination of light and the dichroic vinyl it features.
When it's turned on, it creates an explosion of colors and brings the space to life. When it's turned off, it becomes a mirror of colors.

Creating colors

The 5mm acrylic screens, covered with dichroic vinyl, saturate the space they're in with a variety of colors. Its dichroic vinyl shades create a play of lights and tones in the environment that change depending on how you look at it, making its use a unique experience.
Its bent metal base acts as a pedestal for the screens, turning Dicro into a light totem.

The programme is named Drum: Rock & Light!. The subtitle of the programme is 'Drum' is a 3D printed lamp inspired by musical cymbals. Apart from the central aluminium rod, it is printed with PLA, a filament made from corn.. Description: The 'Drum' lamp is rechargeable, portable, dimmable. It is made of PLA filament with 3D printing and it is inspired by the musical cymbals functioning. In fact Drum has a joint that allows the reflected light beam to be increased or decreased by raising or lowering the lower plate.

Inspiration: Musical drums

Fusing the experiences of a range of different people and cultures, this lamp presents a unique take on the irresistible energy of one of the most iconic musical instruments around. Full of ancestral appeal, it calls to mind the path followed by percussion as it evolved to take its current form.

Functionality: Cymbals shine a light

Thanks to a built-in threaded knob, the bottom plate of the lamp can be raised or lowered to adjust the brightness of the reflected light just as if it were the cymbal of a musical drum kit.

Sustainability: Green design

'Albore' explores cutting-edge 3D printing technology and combines it with more artisanal manufacturing methods to make innovative products. Drum is an example of that. In fact this lamp is entirely 3D printed with PLA filament, except for the central rod, which is instead made of aluminum (100% recyclable) for added strength. PLA is the main material we use for each of our products, and it is an innovative bioplastic made from corn starch and is 100% compostable. For this lamp, we took advantage of PLA Basic for printing the white light-diffusing plates and a PLA Matte for the plates and base, since it is a variant more suitable for post-production sanding and painting with water colors.

About Jacopo Mandarino
'Albore design' is a new brand and 3D printing studio.
We want to write a new story and show that it is possible to make it better for us and our planet. We use 3D printing to produce our designer eco-lamps, with new natural filaments such as PLA.

The programme is named outil.li. The subtitle of the programme is Responsibly develops and produces utilitarian but playful products.. Description: Through our designs, we seek new methods to create products within equitable systems of production and consumption. At Piet Hein Eek during DDW '23, we are unveiling our first product, lighting.

love for good design

outil.li emerges from 15+ years of industrial design experience. It is the tangible outcome of our personal quest for a renewed relationship with our daily objects. We came of age during industrial design’s heyday with Dieter Rams and Ettore Sottsass. Who were both responsible for products marked by honesty, playfulness and intrinsic quality. We are rediscovering these values in our current time. We take into account the contemporarily required broader understanding of a good product's impact over its entire lifecycle.

We are intrigued by the products we use everyday. And in how we, for these products of daily utility and joy, might progress towards systems that produce and consume with minimal negative impact. We base our work on 4 main principles.

our 4 main principles

The delight of a well designed object.
A product remains relevant, in our fleeting time, if it not only functions well but also provides joy. We aim to design products that bring pleasure in both experience and aesthetics. You’ll find this attention up to the smallest detail.

Responsible resources.
We aim to create objects that have as little as possible, or hopefully even no, negative impact on planet and society. Our materials are reused and reusable whenever feasible. Components are standard to eliminate unnecessary new developments. All products are designed to ease disassembly and reuse.

Modern production.
We design for digital production on a small scale. And apart from a few specialised components, we produce everything ourselves. 3D printing and laser cutting enable us to work precisely, locally, and at a scalable level. This minimises unnecessary waste and energy consumption.

Intrinsic quality.
Within the parameters of joy, responsibility, and limited impact, a small demarcated space remains for us to play. Here, we fuzz, noodle and nudge until it works and embodies the right qualities. We hope you recognise this joy in our product.

The programme is named Embassy of Safety. The subtitle of the programme is In the Embassy of Safety we are going to look for new ways of making and making amends.. Description: Those who understand how their criminal actions have impacted others and have managed to reconcile with them are far less likely to be repeat offenders. That’s why we’re searching for additional ways of making amends.

Makind (amends)

Those who commit crimes will be punished. It’s been that way since time immemorial and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future. Is that actually true? No. Societies have employed alternatives to punishment throughout the ages. So-called ‘sanctuaries’, for example, facilitated reconciliation between parties by enforcing rules that protected the offenders and victims alike. Slowly but surely, these historical ideas are making a comeback. For example, community service is now a way for offenders to repay their debt to society. And restorative justice is emerging as a serious alternative to punishment. This process takes into consideration the perspective of the offender and the victim. In fact, reconciliation makes a great deal of sense because after a crime the parties involved want to move on, which is hard to do if they’re still in conflict.

Yet, the process of correcting mistakes and making amends is still the exception to the rule in the Netherlands. And that’s a shame because it works. It’s beneficial not only for those involved but also for society as a whole.

Maakkracht (the power of making)

In recent years, it has become apparent that the professionals in the ‘security chain’ are not always up to the task at hand. Finding enough security professionals is also difficult. Subversive crime is encroaching more and more into all of our daily lives. By contrast, our governmental systems are sometimes so rigid that innocent citizens become victims of state interventions. Isn’t it time to examine our existing approaches critically and ask ourselves what we hope to achieve with them? Are we really doing ‘the right thing’?

For the partners of this Embassy, ​​it could not be clearer: tackling crime has grown increasingly complex; therefore, we cannot carry on as we always have. More than ever, we need new ways of working. That’s why we’re searching for additional ways of making amends.

And for that, the Embassy of Safety is relying upon the power of makers. Our ambition, in direct co-creation with society, is to effect positive changes to help transform complex safety issues. We’ve radically reversed the traditional approach to problem-solving: begin not with the solution, but with the drive of the human being. When people undertake an activity on their own, without knowing where it will lead, this not only provokes change but also sparks the process of learning by doing. That’s the power of making. And we’re all, each and every one of us, a maker.

The programme is named Design Beyond Vision. The subtitle of the programme is Design Beyond Vision presents its research into a multi-sensory, playful installation that reveal Inclusive Design from a sense of touch and hearing.. Description: The playful installation presents a storyline behind the Inclusive Design. By elaborating on the undervalued sensory and emotional part of the design drive, it reveals the basics of human needs in inclusive design, where surviving is the common goal—no matter the differences we have.

Design For All? Design For All Senses!

Within this objective, they developed the first version of an accessible presentation during Milan Design Week in April 2023. It was a multi-sensory and interactive presentation designed by Simon from a non-visual perspective. Visitors were invited to place a ball on a track that rolled down via gravity. The ball disappears from view, but the sound does not and eventually returns to the beginning. The ball was a metaphor for an idea that starts rolling around in your head.


They came up with an interactive presentation and a theatre setting.
Here (mainly abled body), visitors could feel products blindfolded. This form, in which wonder and curiosity played an important role, stimulated dialogue and
was an excellent way to discuss the importance of tactility in the design field


Design Beyond Vision (DBV) is a design and research project by Simon Dogger and Boey wang that wants to add value to design education. It encourages you to look further than what you can see. On the one hand, to make abled body students literary and figuratively feel more. On the other to counter the assumption that the visually impaired do not fit into the design field.

The programme is named Het Kamertje. The subtitle of the programme is Een interactieve performance over regels en macht. Description: Het Kamertje is an interactive performance that takes place in (semi-) public space developed to make people reflect on the extent to which we reproduce existing power structures with our (unconscious) behaviour.

Maintaining the status quo

At regular intervals, the post-new normal is enforced in Het Ketelhuisplein. As a visitor, you will most likely come into contact with the enforcers of the post-new normal. Depending on how you respond to the enforcers, you may or may not be given access to Het Kamertje.

Het Kamertje is an ongoing investigation into power and (unwritten) rules. We humans tend to maintain the status quo, to uphold the prevailing norm. How do you deal with prevailing rules? And what do you do when you are allowed to make the rules yourself?

The programme is named CircleFarm : The community garden. The subtitle of the programme is A smart, social and beautifull way of growing food and communities on urban grounds.. Description: Communal Circlefarming is a method by which growing food together connects people/people and nature. The rotating Compass creates a round vegetable garden that is accessible via the work beds and provides a comfortable, accessible and social context in which to work and stay.

growing food and communities

Circlefarming is an agricultural method that connects people and nature through a new way of growing food.
Growing food is increasingly being used as a method to create social cohesion in existing or new neighbourhoods. The knowledge of crops and cultivation from various cultures is a source of connection. Creating a green environment together, taking care of it during grow time and celebrating the harvest together is a connecting experience.

Circlefarming is a method that facilitates and deepens this. The compass is literally the arm that carries the concept. The work beds move freely under the arm and literally bring the user between the crops with his nose, so that more is seen and experienced. The lying position and the direct connection to the crops provide an intense experience during work and an intimate setting in which a good conversation can take place.

The freely moving Compass and work beds give the soil, crops and animals free space to develop without being disturbed by walkways and boots. Circlefarmers are guests and disturb the crops and animals as little as possible for the most regenerative possible

een sociale en natuur inclusieve methode voor gebieds ontwikkelingen

Door de vrij bewegende Compass en werkbedden heeft de grond, de gewassen en de beesten de vrije ruimte om zich te ontwikkelen zonder verstoord te worden door looppaden en laarzen. Circlefarmers zijn te gast en storen de gewassen en beesten zo min mogelijk voor een zo regeneratief mogelijke situatie.

De Compass is geschikt voor werkbedden, bestaande tractor gereedschappen en later robotica. In de Comunal Circlefarms die vooral binnenstedelijk liggen zullen de gebruikelijke handgereedschappen het meest gebruikt worden, dit is tevens de meest toegankelijke manier om een ieder te betrekken.

Met de Compass, de werkbedden , de veld inrichting en begeleiding vanuit cirlcefarming is een comunal circlefarm een inzichtelijke aantrekkelijke en toegankelijk middel om via voedsel verbouwen mensen en natuur te verbinden. Zo kan deze in bestaande en nieuw te ontwikkelen woon gebieden de basis vormen voor een bewuste en zorgdragende community.

About Floris Schoonderbeek & Rosalie Apituley
Circlefarming is powered by a diverse team of researchers, designers, farmers and partners.
The core team exist of three people but we believe the need and speed for a change in the foodlandscape is huge and so we collaborate with farmers, the WUR, landscape designers and local governments to make circlefarming part of a greener healtier and happier future as soon as possible.

The programme is named Samenbouw: self-build affordable housing. The subtitle of the programme is The first home is now under construction!. Description: Samenbouw is an architectural and social design project aimed at development of affordable and sustainable homes. The homeowner assembles his own house from prefabricated parts, just as easy as assembling a cabinet from a Swedish furniture store. The first home is now under construction!

The design toolbox

Samenbouw is an architectural and social design project aimed at development of affordable homes. Samenbouw is an inclusive design toolbox, it includes a method and process of self-building a house and the co-creation tools for future homeowners, as well as designing a neighbourhood.

The building system

We talk about a system because to achieve our goal within the current situation, in real estate tension, we need to disrupt traditional ways of building. In addition to being a toolbox, Samenbouw is also a building system. It revolutionizes the construction process by rethinking and simplifying each step, enabling even those without construction skills to assemble their homes effortlessly, as if they were assembling furniture. It uses only bio-based and circular elements.

House #1 is under construction, 40 more to come…

The foundation, Stichting Samenbouw aims to build a neighbourhood of 40 homes in Brainport Smart District, in Helmond. With the help of Provincie Noord-Brabant we are currently building house #1, as a pilot project. The future resident, Michaelia, is currently build her own home without the involvement of a construction company, under supervision of Bygg. We monitor the construction of house #1 closely, to learn and improve the system. The location of the project is also Brainport Smart District.

At our DDW location, Plug-in-City, the house prototype will be presented for the first time ever to the public in an interactive setting with the visitors.

Samenbouw is an initiative by Bygg Architecture & Design and VDLP Architecten, with the support of Provincie Noord-Brabant and Gemeente Helmond.

The programme is named Making - 15 years. The subtitle of the programme is Celebrating 15 years of making.. Description: This year Studio Jeroen Wand exists 15 years and shares this special moment with the DDW audience. At our studio we show our way of making in a retrospective of works. We reflect on our past designs, through adding new interpretations.

Making is finding a combination of material and technique

All products that surround us are created from combinations of material and technique. This is the process of making, like sawing wood or welding steel. Making has always been the key ingredient of Studio Jeroen Wand' designs. By conducting research into new combinations, interventions and experimental ways of making, the studio explores new forms and functions.

During the DDW we will show the outcome of 15 years of new ways of making, studies that have led to designs such as a paper chair and glazed constructions.

You are welcome to browse through our sample sale, consisting of our explorations.

Workspace

During the DDW we open our studio and workspace, located in an old garage building, hidden behind a gasstation. Take a peek into our workshop and see how we work.

About Studio Jeroen Wand
Studio Jeroen Wand creates products, objects and installations that challenge the established order. The studio explores the dynamic raw and unpolished part of design, stimulating the search for alternative forms of what is to be considered beautiful or agreeable.

The programme is named Take it Flow. Description: Flow is a mental state in which we experience happiness because we are positively and intensely engaged with something. Thinking, feeling, wanting, and acting align. Flow is an experience of a sense of purpose and energy.

Welcome at Aptum

'Take it Flow' is inspired by the well-known saying 'take it slow', which is of great importance to Tineke Beunders and Nathan Wierink of APTUM. Serenity and attentiveness are central to creating beautiful things, both for themselves, for their clients, and for the environment in which they live. 
The exhibition could be described as showcasing a vision of life'. They not only present their latest designs, they also show their perspective on design and take you through a more than 100-year-old monumental building in the center of Eindhoven, which the duo is restoring themselves. The location has workshops where they extensively experiment and create to their heart's delight. There are exhibition spaces where visitors can view the work of Aptum and collaborations with other creatives. The building itself is even their family's home. It is the place where everything alignes.
Expect wonder, a meaningful experience, and engaging conversations.
Take your time.

Aptum creates custom light installations. Small or large. Sober or colorful. Adaptable to the space and the customer's desires. They present their succesful collections, Light Forest and Contour, in new compositions and color schemes. Additionally, they are launching their latest and third lighting system. The collection reflects their dedication to craftsmanship, technical expertise, and the quest for a touch of magic.

Take it Flow goes beyond that. Aptum consciously seeks collaborations with creatives from other disciplines. Together, they experiment with all forms of creativity,inspiring each other to push far beyond the boundaries of their own field of work.
The latest collaborations are with graphic artist Marije Vermeulen, design studio Lucas & Lucas, and patisserie Pinkie. Previous designs were created with jewelry brand The Boyscouts, animation studio Postnew, designer Femm, and light programmer Studio Tom. All designs from the APTUM X collection can be seen during Dutch Design Week at Take it Flow.

Location: Peelcentrale

The home base of Aptum is 'De Peelcentrale,' a monumental building located in the heart of Eindhoven, the city of light. The site dates back to 1912 and was the city's first power station. It was narrowly saved from demolition. Among the other historic buildings from the same period, they form a fantastic place to be: the NRE area. It serves as a breeding ground for many creatives and entrepreneurs.

About APTUM (by: Ontwerpduo Tineke & Nathan)
Aptum brings wonder, excitement, and magic to the room. Lighting with an expression that can vary from colorful and chaotic to sober and geometric.
Aptum is custom-made lighting, with full service in design, production, and assembly.
Lamps that subdivide like trees, glassware that illuminates without electricity, glowing lines in a space: the fantastic world of Aptum emerges from the collaboration and chemistry between Tineke Beunders and Nathan Wierink.

The programme is named Welcome to Eindhoven Design District. The subtitle of the programme is An initiative to provide design and technology in Eindhoven with a larger stage and encourage design thinking among businesses and government agencies. Description: Thanks to its talented designers, groundbreaking exhibitions, creative districts, innovative businesses, and events with international allure, Eindhoven is packed with the power of design! In this expo you'll find plenty of inspiration to experience Eindhoven Design District for yourself.

Discover design in Eindhoven the whole year round.

Eindhoven presents itself as the design capital of the Netherlands, but this needs to be more widely recognized. With the Eindhoven Design District project, we showcase the city's design DNA to the public. We ensure designs are conspicuous and to be experienced. The focus is on the added value design brings to society and the community, i.e., how does design contribute to sustainable, smart, and pleasant coexistence?

We highlight a number of projects, designers, objects, and locations. These symbolize the significant added value of creation and the rich array of design in Eindhoven.

Eindhoven Design District connects design in the city. On the one hand, through a literal connection in the form of a variety of trails for residents and visitors. On the other, the project provides a metaphorical connection: it allows us to encourage collaborations between designers, government agencies, and the business community.

About Eindhoven Design District
Eindhoven Design District is an Eindhoven Municipality, Dutch Design Foundation (DDF), and Eindhoven365 initiative aimed at providing design and technology in the city with a larger stage and encouraging design thinking among businesses and government agencies. The project is made possible by a contribution from Regio Deal Brainport Eindhoven.

The programme is named Lébayes. The subtitle of the programme is Lébayes is a furniture collection that celebrates the interplay between creativity and tools, bilans and machines.. Description: Lébayes celebrates the interplay between creativity and tools. By harnessing the power of algorithms and computers, we embrace them as valuable collaborators in the creative process.

The relationship between creativity and tools: rethinking collaboration

In the realm of design and artistry, we find ourselves pondering the intricate interplay between creators and their tools. To what extent do our tools contribute to the creative process? A hammer, a computer, an algorithm, etc... they all serve as tools. But do we truly acknowledge and appreciate the profound merits they possess?

Traditionally, we envision individual artists/designers as beings imbued with the capacity for creativity, drawing inspiration from their cultural experiences and surroundings. They enrich their aesthetics through observation and analysis of nature. But what if we dared to relinquish the creative reins to a computer? What if we viewed this machine not merely as a tool, but as a partner, a collaborator, a bona fide designer?

Enter Lébayes, an ongoing conceptual project that challenges our preconceptions. As art directors for this project, we position ourselves in a unique role, harnessing the creative potential of computers. We embrace their software as an environment, an ecosystem, and algorithms as their genetic makeup.

The programme is named Soft memories – Textiles as potential memory. Description: Svenja Bremen, a Textile Designer and graduate of HAW Hamburg, presents her master graduation project, featuring a collection of knitted textiles produced in collaboration with the TextielLab in Tilburg.

Knitted Memories

"Soft memories – Textiles as potential memory" is an innovative design research project that explores the intricate relationship between textiles and memory. Through a meticulous and practice-oriented approach, the project delves into concepts of remembering, forgetting, and memory within the context of textiles. The core of the project showcases an exceptional collection featuring larger textiles and carefully curated research samples, each thoughtfully embedded with diverse personal memory fragments. The project aims to showcase the potential of textiles as carriers of memories, evoking emotional connections and provoking contemplation.

Creation of Textiles

The project involves an innovative process that combines industrial and handcrafted techniques to create captivating textiles. Collaborating with the TextielLab in Tilburg, the main fabrics are knitted using an industrial flat knitting machine, while the preliminary research phase is conducted using hand knitting machines and a handloom. To add depth and intrigue, the artist introduces the "shrinking" technique, which creates a distinctive textured structure in the textiles. This texture conceals embedded memory traces, inviting viewers to engage actively with the fabric, uncovering patterns and hidden memories. Another innovative technique introduced is the "nubs" technique, which involves embedding memory fragments on visual and coded levels. The coded nubs utilize a Nubalphabet based on the Morse code, inviting viewers to decipher the knitted memories. Both techniques provide a high sensory quality and distinct tactility, encouraging touch and exploration. Visitors to the exhibition have the opportunity to actively interact with the fabric, decoding and unraveling memory fragments as they engage with the textiles.

Emotional Connection

At the heart of the project lies the infusion of personal memory fragments into the textiles, emphasizing their emotional significance. These memories are carefully knitted into the fabric, creating a seamless fusion of memory and textile. The project also places a strong emphasis on sustainable practices, with the meticulous selection of materials such as wool. This harmonious blend ensures a balance of texture, structure, and visual appeal, reinforcing the theme of remembering and forgetting in a sustainable and responsible manner. Beyond its artistic value, the project holds great potential for applications in home or interior spaces. The textiles enhance sensory experiences and add a meaningful element of interaction and aesthetic appeal, contributing to a more enriched and mindful environment. In conclusion, "Soft memories – Textiles as potential memory" is a remarkable design research project that artfully intertwines the complexities of memory and textiles. Through innovative techniques and sustainable practices, the project creates textiles that are not only carriers of memories but also powerful tools of communication and emotional connection.

The programme is named Solar Sands - Lighting Collection. The subtitle of the programme is Introducing the Aureole Collection | Where Artistry and Innovation Converge. Description: A collection where light becomes a medium, as it creates an intricate dance of contrast & colour. Welcome to the Aureole Collection - where artistry and innovation merge to create an avant-garde series of wall-mounted lighting pieces that transcend the ordinary and embrace the extraterrestrial.

An Ode to Nature's Intricate Beauty

Inspired by the complex forms of the sunflower's inner disk flowers, the Aureole Collection is an ode to nature's intricate beauty and a testament to the studio's biophilic design principals. The aim was to explore spiralled structures that intertwine with each other, folding and curving to create layers of depth. Each lamp has its own unique surface geometry to distribute and diffuse light and shadow in different ways.

As you move around the lamp, the spirals seem to gravitate, pulling you into their mesmerising embrace. But it's when you stand directly in front that the true magic unfolds. The pattern harmonises into a visual synchrony, leaving the observer without a clear focal point, the experience becomes almost hypnotic.

The Aureole Collection isn't just about lamps; it's about crafting extraordinary art pieces. These experimental creations are born from the fusion of cutting-edge 3D printing technology and the enigmatic beauty of black sand. Like celestial sunflowers in a cosmic garden, these lamps exude an otherworldly aura, invoking a sense of wonder and mystique.

This collection challenges conventions, blurring the line between functionality and artistry.

The programme is named Everyday Paradise – Outsider Arts & Crafts. The subtitle of the programme is Co-curated by Lili Tedde and Lidewij Edelkoort. Description: In this dark period of ongoing war, endless waste, accelerated climate change and our loss of agency to AI, the picture is of absolute gloom and doom. To make life bearable, we need to look elsewhere to search for beauty, soothe our soul and heal our mind; to recompose our battered being.

.

To seek joy, we must go south and take solace in the joyful expressions of the master artisans from the provinces. Their narrative objects depict everyday paradise with birds, flowers and people’s portraits that suddenly become a recipe against this world’s morosity. They use carving, sculpting, painting and embroidery to express the simple splendor of their subject matter. Their obvious delight in light-heartedness, meandering reptiles, domestic animals, overgrowing plants and totemic trees, as well as an extended family of characters, recall the way we were supposed to live in the beginning; from the first day, with the gift of the earth under a cerulean sky, in a place patterned with powerful outsider art images that are born from the complex history of the people. Their traditions and stories deal with a past of slavery, an evolving diaspora and multicultural migration that has created the beautiful melting pot that is called Brazil.

.

The selection of these exotic master pieces was done with the expert eye and experience of Lili Tedde, passionate about helping others discover her beloved Brazil through multiple publications and exhibitions.

The programme is named DommelPolitics. The subtitle of the programme is See how the Dommel changes when animals are in charge, and experience how your vote directly influences the appearance of this waterway.. Description: The City Hall is dedicated to the Dommel, with an interactive presentation. Students from TU/e innovation Space allow you to view the waterway from a different perspective by uniting various animal species into political parties.

Origin

DommelPolitics began as a part of the Art & Tech course at TU/e Innovation Space. The initial objective of this project, initiated by the municipality of Eindhoven and Waterschap De Dommel (the Water Board), was to explore ways to enhance the relationship between the Dommel river and the area's future development. Plans are being formulated to provide more space for nature, facilitating the growth of biodiversity and the connection of habitats for various animal and plant species in this region. These plans are devised by us, humans. As DommelPolitics, we embarked on this project with a different perspective: How do we give the Dommel and its inhabitants a voice in future developments?

About TU/e innovation Space

The programme is named Px, let's think outside of the box. The subtitle of the programme is For sea- and air freight we use reusable containers but over 600 million internet purchase per year are packed in one way carton boxes?. Description: In Px nine small companies have aligned. Our mission is to design a circular flow of sustainable, re-usable packaging for E-commerce. We are based in Eindhoven. We would like to prove that economic activity does not have to come at the cost of our natural resources. Be re-using the same Px.

Should packaging ever end as waste?

Px was born with one thought: What if we start all over and develop transport packaging with the aim to minimise its effects on our valuable natural resources? What if we build a circular flow instead of a product which is used once and then thrown away?

The future is re-use. Again, and again and again.

In our nature waste always has a function. One system feeds the other. Would we also be able to create transport packaging which leaves little or even no waste behind? The European government supports this idea. In 2030 10% of all transport packaging needs to be reusable. In 2040 this goes up to 50 percent.
But what do you think? Are you going to join Px?

The programme is named Interieurvormgeving IV-OHO Thomas More (B). The subtitle of the programme is Interior design - Furniture design - Mechelen (B). Description: The shown pieces of furniture are end- and yearprojects from the students of Thomas More Mechelen (Belgium) – Interiordesign OHO-IV – Open Higher Education Interior Design.
The furniture is made starting from a specific concept, individualy designed and realised by the students.

Tête-à-Tête design

Working students taking a Professional Bachelor’s degree in Interior Design in Open Higher Education at Thomas More University of Applied Sciences in Mechelen (Belgium) are exhibiting their work in the Dutch Design Week 2023.

“Although this is the fourth time we have participated in the Dutch Design Week, it is still an honour to be here. This year we are exhibiting tables designed by third-year students,” explains the course lecturer Wim Valvekens. “They were given the assignment of working on the theme of ‘reflection’. Their interpretations are both literal and figurative, resulting in a highly diverse body of work. The items of furniture were constructed on the basis of a specific concept, and designed and created individually by the students. Each object has its own story and character. We are also exhibiting a series of conceptual knives by fourth-year students. Their assignment was to design a ‘knife’ in the broadest sense of the term.”

About Thomas More - Interieur, Design & Architectuur (B)
We are Interior & Design. We are part of Thomas More, the university college with over 15.500 students and 1.400 staff, and 11 campuses in 7 cities. But our 1000 students and 100 colleagues are also the creative ‘odd man out’ in this college, while keeping our feet firmly on the ground. We look forward to the future world (of design) with Mechelen - the historic heart of Burgundian Flanders and the birthplace of a rich furniture tradition - as our home base.

The programme is named Embassy of Inclusive Society. The subtitle of the programme is The society we live in seems to embrace diversity, but is the work being done to actually become more just?. Description: This year, the Embassy is initiating various (un)learning spaces. Together with the Embassy coalition partners, we gather to exchange current challenges, methods and shared ambitions.

Learning and unlearning

If you look at public discourse and policy changes in the Netherlands, it seems like more space is being made for societal differences. Awareness of the importance of self-expression is growing, and there is more attention to the needs and long-fought rights of groups that have been historically marginalised. At the same time – whether it’s due to increasing inequality, demographic changes and global crises – polarisation and societal gaps are rising. From opposing views during the Covid health crisis, the reactionary backlash to emancipatory movements to heated debates on national narratives. Society is facing challenges with effects cutting across social groups, such as a climate crisis globally and a pending care workers shortage in our ageing society nationally. In a time that calls for solidarity and shared responsibility, it feels like we keep moving further away from one another. While diversity and heterogeneity could offer us the richness of differences, they are still often seen as a problem.

From a solution-driven to a process-driven approach

When treating inclusivity as a problem, we think it needs solving. That results in temporary fixes, protocols and tokenism. Look at work culture as an example: high speed and performance pressures offer little space for actual change in how people relate to one another. While diversity and inclusion are high on the agenda of many organisations, they are often reduced to protocols on paper and vaguely formulated ambitions on paper. The solution-driven approach to inclusivity overlooks the deeper values of plurality and multiplicity and the transfer of power that is needed for real systemic change. Too often, efforts for inclusivity maintain the division of society into many sub-groups rather than searching for connections.

What does it mean to be different in a way that is mindful and respectful of each other’s humanity? It is a chance to evolve as a society, to grow together from and with our differences. This requires actively committing to a continuous journey. The Embassy of Inclusive Society thinks of inclusivity as an ongoing process of learning and unlearning.

Learning and unlearning

What do we need to (un)learn to live together with differences? Which skills, attitudes, practices, routines, and habits are essential for a society of belonging? And how can designers and makers play a role in crafting moments, tools and spaces for (un)learning?

Learning and unlearning is a process-oriented approach where the value lies in the quest rather than the outcome. As part of this approach, the Embassy seeks to deepen existing relationships we have established with our partners and to build on past collaborations and efforts. We aim to make space for community-driven creative initiatives. Working towards a more inclusive society can be done by shedding light on the knowledge, skills, practices and activities existing within different communities rather than starting from scratch every time.

With spatial experiments, we explore how different bodily needs can be facilitated in inclusive spaces. We challenge our thinking patterns so that different people can access, participate, and engage with one another. Practising inclusivity means building skills, tools, attitudes, and habits; building the inclusivity muscle requires constant training, strengthening and maintenance.

The programme is named 1000 Hours. The subtitle of the programme is 1000 Hours explores the relationship between producers and consumers through a material and historical investigation of the lightbulb. Description: As a counteraction to the legacy of lightbulbs in planned obsolescence, '1000 Hours' preserves daylight in ceramic ampoules, aiming to bring the power back into the hands of consumers.

The Rule of Light

Since the 19th century, with the introduction of the bulb, humanity has become one step closer to controlling time. By preserving and extending the daylight hours, we no longer depend on sunlight and have complete control over our schedules. But as we freed ourselves from the solar cycle, we became very much reliant on lightbulb manufacturers. In 1924, with the development of technology and industry, the incandescent lightbulb became highly efficient and durable—which led to a dramatic drop in sales. In December of the same year, representatives of the 10 leading lightbulb manufacturers gathered in Geneva and founded the Phoebus Cartel—a global-scale supervisory body for lightbulb production.

Together, the cartel members engineered a lightbulb with a relatively short life span—1000 hours—a sharp reduction from 2000 hours that had previously been common. By doing so, the cartel formulated a new industrial strategy now known as "Planned Obsolescence", which serves the economic interests of manufacturers while exploiting valuable natural resources.

Although the cartel lasted only until the 1930s, the legacy of planned obsolescence still remains a widespread strategy used by brands and companies worldwide. Today, life-shortening manipulations are becoming more and more sophisticated and harder to detect. By that, the lightbulb became not only a symbol of innovation and technological development but also of the misuse of design—serving the economic interests of manufacturers and thus dictating the relationship between consumers and their products, ensuring continuous consumption.

As a counteraction to this strategy, the project seeks to bring the power back to the hands of the consumer, using 10 ceramic vessels that act as ampoules for preserving daylight—a term used in the lighting industry to describe the color temperature of midday light. Each ampoule contains a specific daylight color glaze, sampled from each of the cartel’s member countries. For the hues to be seen—like a piggy bank—the ampoules must be broken. Additionally, a series of Cyanotype prints—a photographic printing technique that uses UV-sensitive chemicals, materialize the story of household bulbs.

The programme is named Embassy of Mobility. The subtitle of the programme is Creating liveable cities together, that is what the Embassy of Mobility stands for.. Description: What does our city look like without cars in front of the door? And what do we get in place of them? More greenery? More homes? Places to get together and relax? We will explore these questions together and experiment with possible solutions.

People first

In the coming years, Dutch Design Week (DDW) will be the living lab for the Embassy of Mobility. During DDW, we show how makers work together to make the mobility transition tangible and understandable. In a living setting, we research and present new proposals that visitors can test in the complexity of real life and daily practice. Visitors will do this by, among other things, literally moving between the various locations.

Innovations on an organisational and/or social level are more often decisive than technical ingenuity. The innovation must fit the context. That is why we are going to talk to policymakers, scientists, professionals at companies, residents, travellers and DDW visitors. Together we can explore the new values ​​created by redesigning public space. This requires a long-term perspective and a drive to experiment, principles we embrace as the Embassy of Mobility.

In addition, we assume that it is precisely creative makership that helps to improve the quality of life in cities further. We also focus on the quality of life and the happiness of the future generation in order to make the necessary mobility transition a reality. That is the key to real change.

What happens if we facilitate the makership of citizens? What initiatives will they create for their own living environment? How does this strengthen the sense of joint responsibility for a liveable society? What if civil servants use their creative power to develop good commissioning practices? On which human values do we base our quality of life designs? Can companies and industries develop services and products that contribute to a liveable city? What role does the Embassy play in this? As an Embassy, ​​we are curious about how to strengthen collaboration between creative makers and mobility professionals. There are many roads to walk, which we would like to discover together with you.

Join us on a journey of discovery into new behaviours and relationships that contribute to more liveable cities where the happiness of future generations is front and centre. The destination, and indeed the moment we’ll reach it, is unknown. But by following the right course with the power of makers and a keen eye, we’ll be able to recognise the quality and unforeseen created value when it presents itself. We are looking for as many travel companions as possible.

The programme is named DRIP040. The subtitle of the programme is Don’t worry just sport!. Description: The DRIP Foundation believes that all children and youth deserve equal opportunities. Everywhere and always, including at the sports club. Without social pressure, without judgment, without distinction. With DRIP040 we put the essence together: Don't worry just Sport!

Don’t worry just sport!

The DRIP Foundation believes that all children and youth deserve equal opportunities. Everywhere and always, including at the sports club. Without social pressure, without judgment, without discrimination. In the locker room, however, the differences are often already visible. One is wearing the latest shirt from an exclusive label, the other puts on the unbranded, washed-out shirt again. Inequality that lowers the enjoyment of sport and raises the threshold.

The DRIP Foundation takes this to heart and is doing something about it. The solidarity-based, circular sportswear brand. You buy DRIP to pass it on. To your teammate or sports club in your region. Or as a parent to your own child. Because DRIP breaks down social barriers very cool too. Everyone wants to wear that! In that everyone wants to play sports!

How we work

All activities we undertake will be designed from the core values: approachable, fun, simple and meaningful. As a foundation, DRIP carries out the following activities to achieve its goal:

1. Collecting and passing on sportswear / sports materials in the Eindhoven region based on the "donate with dignity" principle;
2. Making collected sportswear directly available to athletes & teams in an accessible way, including in cooperation with sports clubs in the area;
3. Making sports experiences available for free

Collecting and passing on

Everyone with sporting children experiences how quickly they grow and thus new sportswear is often needed. Often the sportswear (shoes & clothes) that is too small is not worn out at all and can be passed on just fine. Through DRIP, you ensure that your sportswear is passed on with dignity and respect to people in and around the city who can use it. This way you not only give your clothing a second life, but you also help someone who could really use it!

When you donate your sportswear we make sure that:

1. A check is done on the status of the clothes.
2. It is clean & smells good when it is passed on.
3. Your clothing gets a second life via the right route in the right place

About Stichting DRIP
The DRIP Foundation is an organization dedicated to young people (ages 4 to 18) to best support equity in sports.

DRIP stands for fair opportunities for young people who have it harder (socially/economically) than others. Having the right & cool sportswear or materials on the sports field is not a given for everyone.

DRIP changes this and takes low-threshold circular clothing and material use to the next level.

The programme is named Food for Thought. The subtitle of the programme is Our global food system through the lens of Kadir van Lohuizen. Description: From 3 November onwards, The National Maritime Museum in Amsterdam presents the exhibition Food for Thought: a look into our global food system, seen through the lens of photographer and filmmaker Kadir van Lohuizen.

Where does your food come from?

We’ve grown used to well-stocked shelves and a range of choices in our shops. Green beans from Kenya, avocados from Peru and strawberries in winter. This abundance is enabled by a complex worldwide system in which the Netherlands - as second largest exporter of agragrian products - plays a key role. In the multimedia exhibition Food for Thought - on show at The National Maritime Museum from 3 November onwards - photographer and filmmaker Kadir van Lohuizen investigates the world behind the food on your plate.

Where does our food come from? Where does it go? What role do shipping and the Netherlands play in the global food system?

Step inside the world of the global food industry

During Dutch Design Week, The National Maritime Museum provides a sneak peak of the exhibition Food for Thought at Ketelhuisplein. Step into the mystical container and immerse yourself in the world of our food. Take a deep dive into Van Lohuizen's work, the many facets of our food industry, and mind-boggling insights that you likely didn't hear before.

The programme is named Magic Millstone. The subtitle of the programme is A Folklore Reimagined: Imprints of Tradition in Digital Horizons. Description: "Magic Millstone" explores traditional Korean folktales merging Sun Lee's Hanji paper sculpture with spacekkabbi's digital artefacts. This immersive installation invites visitors to traverse the boundaries between tradition and virtual space while questioning the future of traditional crafts.

Magic Millstone

In Korean traditional folktales, various everyday crafts were depicted with extraordinary powers as key enablers of the stories. Among them, the "Magic Millstone" is a fascinating object that, when the millstone is ground, can produce any item one wishes for. These traditional folk crafts maintain their practical functions from reality while incorporating supernatural abilities.

This project uses the "Magic Millstone'' tale as a compass to create a vibrant installation by adding imagination and expressiveness to the materials, techniques, and forms of craftsmanship. Textile artist Sun Lee and 3D artist spacekkabbi blend their respective craft and digital techniques to create an installation bridging both realms. With Sun Lee’s Hanji Paper sculpture enabling and triggering spacekkabbi’s 3D objects by utilizing the Unknown Ocean team's AR technology, the Magic Millstone immersive installation aims to explore alternative artistic expressions in the preservation and evolution of craftsmanship.

Furthermore, visitors will have the opportunity to freely traverse the boundaries between tradition and virtual space, experiencing the awkwardness and collisions that arise from the interaction of digital and physical, intangible and tangible. They will also contemplate digital approaches through the perspective of traditional craft, providing a space for modern artists to propose craftsmanship as not merely objects but as mediums or new attitudes and behaviors that stimulate imagination. This exhibition will serve as an experimental ground for contemplating new definitions of traditional crafts and the direction in which it will harmonize with the next generation.

About Sun Lee, spacekkabbi
Sun Lee is a Korean designer based in Amsterdam fascinated by the historical, political and cultural impact of traditional craft in our modern society. Her design practice is a genealogical odyssey that critically and practically challenges the history of craft into our globalized realm. Spacekkabi is a Korean 3D artist inspired by ancient stories and myths. She aims to evoke wonder, inviting viewers into a realm where traditional tales merge with the limitless possibilities of digital art.

The programme is named TIMELESSTIME by MAISON the FAUX. The subtitle of the programme is The complex experience of time and timelessness, lack of time and eternal value is at the heart of TIMELESSTIME by MAISON the FAUX.. Description: TIMELESSTIME covers and transforms the entire space of MU. During DDW, performances with audiences take place, which are recorded and once again become part of the scenography. As a result, the storytelling tour becomes a form of wild tracking through time.

TIMELESSTIME

The complex experience of time and timelessness, lack of time and eternal value is at the heart of TIMELESSTIME by MAISON the FAUX. Do we lose or gain time with the passing of the years? Is mortality on our heels or do we just think it is? Does physical deterioration only make us vulnerable and fearful of death or is it the driving force to create, to philosophize, to believe, to destroy...?

MAISON the FAUX explores these questions with the meandering installation TIMELESSTIME in which performers make scenes come to life at set intervals. As in a story ride, without beginning or end, the audience is drawn into a timeless cycle of creation and decay. Experience how time affects the essence of making and that which is made. Everything changes with the ticking of time, sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly, while matter and maker themselves unmistakably change with it.

Live Performances

Fridays 22 + 29 Sept. | 6 + 13 Oct. | 3, 10, 17 and 24 Nov. from 16:00 to 19:00

During DDW23 there will be live performances as part of TIMELESSTIME on Sat. 21, Sun. 22, Wed. 25, Thu. 26, Fri. 27, Sat. 28 and Sun. 29 October from 14:00 to 17:00.

MAISON the FAUX are Tessa de Boer and Joris Suk +++ Performances by Arno Verbruggen, Jordan Achiano and Nora Monsecour +++ Choreography by Tatiana Matveeva +++ Sound design by A. Crespo Barba +++ Art objects by Esmay Wagemans and Dae Uk Kim.

The programme is named Regeneration - Fashion from the Ground Up. The subtitle of the programme is Fashion from the Ground Up. Description: To collectively explore the meaning of regeneration in fashion, New Order of Fashion unites twelve emerging designers from across the globe. Ready to embark on a holistic quest to heal fashion — and planet! — through a care for all approach.

Regeneration

Regeneration: The process of regenerating - renewing or restoring something after it has been depleted, damaged or lost.

The term regeneration made a relatively modest debut in the fashion field a mere few years ago. Gaining prominence among a growing audience of fashion lovers, the concept was embodied through an unexpected match with agriculture. What do farming and fashion have in common you may ask?

Mode Landbouw

Regenerative agriculture focuses on a harmonious collaboration with nature, on the basis of indigenous ecological knowledge. Instead of depleting the land, numerous techniques are applied to enrich the soil, improve water systems and increase biodiversity.

A harvest of raw materials and respectful treatment thereof, allows for the development of so-called ‘farm-to-closet' items: clothing that not only originates from our fertile soil but can also return as compost to complete a fully natural, circular life cycle.

Origins and Destination

In addition to being a promising alternative to counter balance a rampant fashion industry, regeneration poses fundamental questions about the origins of both our clothing as well as ourselves. Where do we come from and where are we heading?

To collectively explore the meaning of regeneration in fashion, New Order of Fashion unites 15 emerging designers from across the globe. Ready to embark on a holistic quest to heal fashion — and planet! — through a care for all approach.

About New Order of Fashion
New Order of Fashion (NOoF) is a research and talent development
platform supporting emerging fashion visionaries. Through exhibitions, activations and research activites, we strive to enrich the discourse around sustainable approaches to fashion and textiles — to support those exemplary practitioners that are at the forefront of the sustainability revolution.

The programme is named BRUTALISTA. The subtitle of the programme is Functional objects created with ‘the brutal idea' – One Sheet. One Saw. One Object.. Description: In the series of functional objects entitled ‘BRUTALISTA’, the designer takes over the tool from the craftsman, more specifically, the handsaw.
One sheet of timber-based material and the availability of only one handsaw is ‘the brutal idea’ behind this project – One Sheet. One Saw. One Object.

The more restrictions, the greater the challenge

Limitations make it easier to make choices in the design process, but also challenge you to explore the possibilities to the fullest.
This approach has led to monumental functional objects, in which a preference for 'brutalist architecture' is clearly visible.

Ode to the saw

In the series of objects entitled ‘BRUTALISTA’, the designer takes over the tool from the craftsman. The limited possibilities of the handsaw determine not only the shape of the object, but also the texture of the surface. The saw shows its commitment as we rarely or never see it in the craft; rough and unpolished in its fairest form.

A visual, sensual and written exploration resulting in an artistic book that celebrates the working process of textile artist Marie Schumann and the craftsmanship of EE.

A woven artist book

Etymologically „text“ roots in the latin texere: to weave. The material itself is a carrier of history, of interconnections and networks, a thinking space, and a collective memory.  The artist book picks up this thread and documents a working process. We see visual impressions that show textile presence in our environment, we can read threads that open our textile connections to history or different material potentials come up through sensual experiences. It is an open invitation to explore your material connections.

Description: Marlou Rutten and Marieke van de Ven aim to build a bridge between their fields of product- and textile design with 'Jakari', a 3D woven light object developed in collaboration with WEEEF.

Exploring the synergy between light and material

In collaboration with WEEEF, the duo developed a textile made from paper yarn that explores the synergy between light and material. ‘Jakari’ is a 3D woven light object that is made directly on the loom. The light unfolds from a flat piece of woven fabric and emphasizes the natural drape of the yarn, giving the lamp a sculptural character.

The programme is named Mind or Matter. The subtitle of the programme is The story behind Critical Raw Materials. Description: Microscopically small molecules of rare earth materials have been greatly magnified into large brightly colored ceramic objects. Their giant size is matched to the huge impact these materials will have in our society. Though they seem whimsical from a distance, they actually mean serious business.

What are Critical Raw Materials?

Critical Raw Materials (CRM’s) are the key to society’s transition to clean energy and a green society. We desperately need these metals, minerals and other rare earth materials to manufacture our renewable energy and other critical technologies, as developed by our knowledge based industry. Technologies that form the engine of our prosperity and security.

And so....?

However, these materials are often rare, mostly mined and refined by just a handful of countries (almost none of them in Europe), and practically impossible to recycle within our current lacking supply-chain system. Moreo-ver, in the next two decades our demand for these materials will skyrocket as we aim to decarbonize our economy by 2050.
Critical Raw Materials producing countries have been buying mines internationally and placing export re-strictions on their production. Both start (extraction) and end (disposal) of the supply chain of these scarce materials happen out of our sight and are paired with large environmental and social harm to which we seem oblivious in our daily life. CRM’s form important bar-gaining chips in the geopolitical arena.
The necessity for a carbon neutral society is evident, but is our current approach on a collision course with reality?

Mind over Matter or Matter over Mind?

The programme is named Living_in_the_Dome. The subtitle of the programme is Discover the world of dome buildings, where sustainability, beauty and serenity come together.. Description: Domes have been a part of human history since ancient times. They occur in all cultures and in all times, usually built from local, natural materials. In recent years they have been gaining popularity thanks to their elegant geometric shapes and their specific qualities.

The Dome project

A combination of the organic form of Domes, build with natural construction and insulation materials, has gained popularity in Poland in recent years. The architectural office Ekocentrycy has been involved in dome construction in Poland since 2018. We combine lightweight timber structures with hempcrete insulation and are currently working on several family homes, vacation cottages, and hotels in circular shapes.
A stay in a Dome provides a remarkable experience of inner peace and connection with the surroundings. Users may also experience gentle chills. This project aims to investigate the effects of these structures on people's well-being and health.
The structural efficiency and stability of Domes make them suitable for various climate conditions, including extreme weather. They are often associated with sustainability and environmental friendliness due to their form, which encourages efficient use of materials. Additionally, they require less energy for heating.
A special case of fractal forms is the Zome shape, which has a strong impact on people. The construction idea is based on repeatable spiral modules, and we present a Zome shape 3m high covered with biobased panels.

About Domes and fractal forms

Every natural object in the universe has to obey the rule of the golden mean ratio. From the cells of our bodies, to the spiral galaxies of the univeserse all is based on this basic proportion. During the ages this knowledge was used practically in the construction process of singular buidings, dwellings or entire cities.  Plans of Prague, Cracov or Den Bosch, based on complicated, precise geometrical patterns are an obvious proof of knowlegde we don't even fully uderstandModern science became aware of it's meaning for the first time in 70-ties in XX century, when Polish-French mathematician Mandelbrot described principles of fractal geometry in his work. We are facing a revolution in many fields of science and technology. Strange enough in modern architecture reintroduction of  Fractal  Geometry principles is going very slowly. Meanwhile it can be applied in the building industry in many ways to enhance the quality of a living space, and might eventually become a new and practical tool for sustainable development.
Dome buildings, and especially Zome structures, thanks to their spiral form of construction, allow you to experience the fractal effect live.

The programme is named NORMA. The subtitle of the programme is "If I'd observed all the rules, I'd never got anywhere." Norma Jean Baker. Description: Norma is a poetic structure of sanded stainless steel. There is no table top, only 7 frail legs that form the basis for a romantic tête-à-tête: 2 plates, 2 cups, 1 wine bucket and 2 holders for napkins or candles. Crockery and construction become inseparable. And maybe the eaters too.

Marilyn

“Who do you want to sit down with for an evening”

I started from Marilyn Monroe and her two faces: the side the whole world knows, grand, voluptuous, overwhelming, a superstar and the side hardly anyone ever saw. The real Marilyn: Norma Jean Baker. Soft, introverted, almost a gray mouse. The word “hardly” floated to the surface. So I set to work with the idea that I would design “hardly a table”. And so Norma was created, a composition rather than a table.

Feature

The crockery is mounted on a rod that slides into the legs of the table, so it is removable and also washable!

The programme is named FLAWED. The subtitle of the programme is Can you spot the imperfection?. Description: '' Sometimes a little imperfection is what makes things perfect"

Symbolization

This table symbolizes the constant pursuit of perfection in our society. It's okay to accept imperfections, they are part of being human. The symbolization is very subtle, you can find it in one table leg. it deviates slightly from its place. Therefore it's imperfect but still necessary. Without the table leg, the table cannot stand.

The Center brings together diverse people with different expertise to enhance unexpected findings and breakthroughs in material research.

Unexpected biomaterial findings through collaboration

To solve complex sustainability challenges, we need not only new ideas and concepts, but also new interdisciplinary collaboration and actions to implement them. Often collaboration is seen as a list of names in a project description, or as a list of authors in a publication – but that is not enough.

The Bioinnovation Center brings together diverse people with different expertise to enhance unexpected findings and breakthroughs in material research. The aim is to create bridges between disciplines, to inspire thinking and to grow networks. The Bioinnovation Center community wants to explore new working methods in material research, and to share the learnings with others.

The Center focuses on sustainable bio-based materials, aiming to decrease the dependency of fossil-based materials and harmful chemicals. The main focus is on textiles and packaging.

The programme is named MARCOS KUEH. Description: MARCOS KUEH

In Borneo, people wove their myths and stories into textiles, to convey certain morals and values. Marcos Kueh
sees his practice as a contemporary version of this. His work deals with postcolonialism and researches which
stories we want to preserve. He uses techniques from various Southeast Asian countries and combines them with
thorough knowledge of every machine he uses, with his experience in all kinds of weaving looms, and designs
and develops his own textiles. This is how Marcos makes invisible gods, spirits and ideas visible, so that we start
thinking about their relevance. The question he asks his audience: Do you just see beautiful textiles? Or are you
really listening?

The programme is named Studio Fontana. Description: GABRIEL FONTANA

Gabriel Fontana uses sport as a metaphor for society in his work: what rules have we agreed upon in the past,
and do they now work for us or against us? He researches how our bodies propagate, internalise and reproduce
social norms and proposes ways to unlearn this behaviour. As such, he designs and develops new forms of
pedagogy, activities and games. His work focuses on inclusion and reaches different layers of society through
education, culture and the sports industry. His educational programme Multiform (2019) contributes to inclusive
physical education and Tournament of the Unknown (2022) is a tournament series that gives new meaning to our
idea of togetherness.

The programme is named Sampat Studio. Description: Wayang Kulit

Sampat Studio – a collaboration between Malaysian design duo Marcos Kueh and Isabelle Nair-Lacheta –
interweaves the physical with the digital, and the tangible with the intangible. The designers share the belief,
deeply-rooted in Asia, that every object has its own spiritual properties. Bursting with Southeast Asian symbolism,
their colourful tapestry tells the tale of the spirit of a female warrior in the style of Wayang Kulit (traditional shadow
puppetry). It depicts the space in which the warrior resides, and which remains hidden, elusive to the naked eye.
A new layer to the story is revealed through augmented reality. Without that virtual layer, the descriptions

The programme is named Studio Daeukkim. Description: DAE UK KIM

Dae Uk Kim uses objects as alter egos to express, explain and fulfil his dreams and desires. Desires that he had
to suppress and hide while growing up in Korea. By making mutated objects, he now converts his shame into
pride as a designer. Dea Uk Kim explores themes like gender expression, race and cultural identity by combining
various mediums with the creation of physical objects. His MUTANT series can be seen as functional objects – a

chandelier, mirror, stool and console – but the most important thing for him is the narrative. By depicting non-
human things as beings, he brings the underlying story to life.

The programme is named Super Local. Description: From the Himalayas

The Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal is the home of Mount Everest and attracts over eighty thousand visitors
every year. This leads to tragic amounts of waste and puts pressure on the vulnerable ecosystem. Super Local
and Sagarmatha Next are working together on the ‘Carry me back’ system. It involves local residents and tourists
in the region carrying tons of waste back to Kathmandu, where it is recycled. Super Local processes water bottle
caps into the ‘From the Himalayas’ collection: three pebble-shaped plastic stones and a scale model of Himalayan
peaks. A perfect memento for tourists, with which they can continue to express their environmental responsibility
at home. The proceeds finance the workshop and staff that form the foundations of this project.

The programme is named Omlab. Description: NATUURVRIENDELIJKE STARTERSWONING VOOR DE ZWALUW | OMLAB

Omlab introduces 3D printed swallow’s nests that last a few years: prefab starter homes for house and barn
swallows, made using circular and bio-based raw materials. Without (wood)concrete, glue or nails, so that no
waste ends up in the natural environment. The goal is self-construction: the swallow is a true do-it-yourselfer if

people don’t get in the way. These temporary nests are intended to be used in areas that have undergone large-
scale development or where nature-inclusive management is just getting started. At a certain point, the swallows

will find sources of food and water the area. The birds then mix their own mortar for the construction of the next
nest, in bio-plastic housing for example. Meanwhile, the calcium-rich starter homes break down and enrich the soil.

The programme is named De Groenmarkt. Description: RONALD JANSSEN ARCHITECTEN x BASTIAAN JONGERIUS ARCHITECTEN x BURO HARRO

The Groenmarkt housing project in Amsterdam focuses on the healthy lives of people, plants and animals. All the
homes are different; from houses with a front door opening out onto the street, to apartments and duplexes. This
ensures diversity among the residents of the two buildings on Marnixstraat and Singelgracht. Good care homes
for the elderly were central in defining the structure of all the homes in the Singelgracht building. There is plenty of
space for greenery on the facade, which grows upwards from the ground through recesses in the construction.
The communal roof is home to a dune-like landscape with a natural swimming pool as its highlight. Residents can
come here for a breath of fresh air, to exercise and to meet their neighbours, with a great view over the historic
city centre.

The programme is named Arcadia X Gemeente Leeuwarden. Description: BOSK

Bosk is a walking forest of more than a thousand trees, which took over the city centre of Leeuwarden for a
hundred days in the summer of 2022. It began with an almost impossible plan, full of ambitious goals. From
radical imagination to behavioural change, and from the mobilisation of social energy to strengthening the
economic and creative climate in Fryslân. Residents and passers-by repeatedly moved the trees to their new
location, resulting in Bosk covering a total distance of 3.5 kilometres. A successful cultural and educational
programme emerged, for and by a whole range of people – including no less than 4,000 volunteers – and
organisations. Bosk is part of cultural triennial Arcadia.

The programme is named HENK. Description: Lisa Konno

HENK is a multidisciplinary portrait of the Surinamese-Dutch caretaker of the Rietveld Academy. Dressed in a
fashion collection inspired by his life, Henk Shakison presents his idiosyncratic view on migration and success.
The project consists of a film, fashion collection and a book. HENK is the final part in a triptych of portraits
depicting fathers with a migration background by makers Lisa Konno (fashion designer) & Sarah Blok (director).
Each father (NOBU, BABA, HENK) wears a collection inspired by his life story and bi-cultural identity. HENK
shows both wealth and the division that postcolonial migration brought to his life. Different perspectives on the
theme of ‘recognition’ play an important, and sometimes surprising, role in this project.

The programme is named Kuang-Yi Ku X Henry de Vries. Description: ATLAS OF QUEER ANATOMY

The standards in classical medical anatomy cause discrimination and create serious problems in (access to)
clinical treatments. with the Atlas of Queer Anatomy, designer Kuang-Yi Ku and medical professor Henry de Vries
challenge Western, white and heteronormative dominance in anatomical education. The visualisations offer an
ironic reflection on the still widely used textbook ‘Atlas of Human Anatomy’, (Frank H. Netter, 1957). Kuang-Yi Ku
and Henry de Vries want to increase the inclusiveness of anatomy within and outside medicine. The project
includes workshops in which young doctors and creatives are invited to make their own queer anatomical
collages, which are then incorporated into the atlas.

The programme is named FASHION (EXPO AT FOAM). Description: Paul Kooiker

The solo exhibition FASHION by Paul Kooiker at FOAM in Amsterdam brings together images from his fashion
assignments in one total installation. It works like a palace of mirrors: it brings the speed of the fashion world to a
standstill and depicts the absurdity of human vanity and desire. All the photos were taken with an iPhone. In a
time when everyone takes photos with a smartphone, Paul Kooiker uses precisely this tool to create a parallel
world that is one of a kind. Just like in his assignments for the fashion industry, Paul Kooiker steps outside the
boundaries of prevailing beauty ideals and gender roles.

The programme is named De Kunstwerf. Description: STUDIO DONNA VAN MILLIGEN BIELKE x ARD DE VRIES ARCHITECTEN

Groningen celebrates the performing arts with De Kunstwerf. It is not uncommon for theatre companies to be
tucked away in invisible places. But here, a home has been designed especially for them. A place where not only
users but also residents of Groningen and other visitors are welcome. This is why the heart of De Kunstwerf is not
the theatre itself, but the inner garden, designed by Piet Oudolf as a succession of public spaces and including an
intimate amphitheatre. Both audience and actors come together in the garden; a space that provides seclusion
and intimacy, but above all visibility. Every company has its own front door, kitchen, work and rehearsal rooms. In
the garden there is plenty of space for meeting and peeking behind the scenes of the theatre groups.

The programme is named Studio Claudy Jongstra. Description: LOADS

LOADS is a self-integrated and financed project by Studio Claudy Jongstra. The goal is to stimulate specific
agricultural projects – such as the biodynamic cultivation of dye plants – and the development of educational and
social projects. The studio works together with a variety of professionals to retain and pass on knowledge: from
traditional crafts to manufacturing processes and from recipes to natural materials, textures and techniques. The
doors are open to everyone who wants to learn to live holistically: students, designers, farmers, scientists and
companies. LOADS has the entire manufacturing chain in-house, which created a closed cycle. From LOADS,
Claudy Jongstra initiates masterclasses and events, master-apprentice programmes, new collaborations and an
artist-in-residency.

The programme is named Studio Carlijn Kingma. Description: HET WATERWERK VAN ONS GELD

Those who do not speak the complicated financial language of economists and bankers are excluded from the
social debate about our monetary system. This stands in the way of addressing problems such as the growing
inequality and recurring financial crises. This is why cartographer Carlijn Kingma – in collaboration with financial
economists Thomas Bollen and Martijn van der Linden – made the world of money accessible with metaphors
and architectonic illustrations. If you compare money to water, then our monetary system is the irrigation system
that waters the economy. But our society’s waterworks are not a natural phenomenon: what they look like is a
political choice. Kingma visualises how our monetary system works and sketches possibilities for reform.

The programme is named Ambassade van de Noordzee. Description: VERNIEUWING IN HET RECHT: DE NOORDZEE AAN HET WOORD

The sea and life in the sea is its own entity, that is the viewpoint of the Embassy of the North Sea. A mock court in
the Peace Palace in The Hague became the final step in establishing the Embassy of the North Sea (2018-2022).
Its mission is to give nature a position in our culture, politics and legal system. This experiment investigated how
non-human voices could be heard in a courtroom. Human and non-human witnesses were called and spoke on
behalf of facets of the North Sea. The Embassy first wanted to learn to listen to the North Sea, in order to learn to
speak with it and on its behalf in the coming years.

The programme is named Random Studio. Description: ROMANTIC FUTURISM: A DIGITAL FRESCO FOR GUCCI CHENGDU

Random Studio was commissioned by Gucci to create content for the interior of its new space in a department
store in Chengdu, China. The designers transformed the walls into a flowing image. The digital fresco unfolds
over 33 large LED screens and consists of layers of AI-generated images that blend together to create a
constantly changing fantasy landscape. The once static architecture of the building changes into a living interior.
Pictures of Chinese hibiscus and Florentine architecture from the fashion house’s homeland, combine with natural
elements that create references to both past and present, and to local and cultural interfaces.

The programme is named CleverFranke. Description: VOICES FROM THE FRONTLINE - AFRICA CLIMATE MOBILITY INITIATIVE WEBSITE

Climate change is changing our world. Across Africa, climate change is already leading to increased levels of
forced migration and displacement, also known as climate mobility. It is estimated that by 2050, up to 113 million
people in Africa will move as a result of climate change. CLEVER°FRANKE designed and developed a visually
rich website and report. The design agency helped the Global Centre for Climate Mobility to visualise the correct
insights from two years of research. These were translated into stories that present the problem in an
understandable and tangible way, for those affected, journalists and policy makers. The main focus lies on the
people involved and showing the local consequences of climate change.

The programme is named Thijs Biersteker - Woven Studio. Description: MB>CO2

MB>CO2 shows the impact of our daily data use on the planet. The data visualisation shows that our video
meetings, binge-watching and AI algorithms have hidden consequences. By calling in via Zoom, this art
installation makes an estimation of your data use and an accompanying C02 calculation and translates this into
cloudy CO2 puffs that are blown into a planet-like biotope. Woven Studio raises questions about a more
sustainable use of data and AI. Once we realise that a Zoom meeting is equivalent to driving 140 meters in a
petrol-powered car, a streaming session generates 900 grams of C02 emissions and trading a single NFT costs
400 kilos of fresh air, the real consequences of our data use become clear.

The programme is named Candyland. Description: Simone Post

Simone Post designed two shop windows for the French fashion house Hermès for their most prominent store in
Ginza, Tokyo. Using a playful dreamworld of colourful candy, the designer gave shape to the Hermès theme for
2022: Living in Lightness. Simone placed ten-metre-long cables of yellow and pink marshmallow in a different
context, by twisting and weaving them like textile threads. The resulting rugs, furniture, curtains, window frames
and plants were all made from candy. The sixteen mini shop windows became miniature worlds, with tiny mirrors
and plates: a nod to Alice in Wonderland. Simone Post created a fantastic world, magical and enticing.

THE NEW STIJL is a bombastic festival of a book, composed from different disciplines and styles. A visual
exploration and collection of modern high-profile Dutch creativity, at a time when national identity is being defined
less and less by physical boundaries. Successful, influential and talented Dutch creatives can be found
everywhere. Born, raised or educated in our country, they bring innovation and change far beyond our borders.
THE NEW STIJL presents work by dreamers, doers and disruptive thinkers who challenge us to look at things
differently. What does Dutch creativity mean and who will emerge as its guardians in the coming years?

The programme is named Christien Meidertsma X Rotterdam Circulair. Description: DE ZACHTE STAD

2500 sheep graze in the Rotterdam metropolitan area, keeping the grass short in public spaces. The thousands of
kilos of wool they produce are almost worthless in the Netherlands and are burned or shipped to China.
Unbelievable, thought sheepherder Martin Oosthoek, in a time of raw material scarcity and climate change, which
led to the project The Soft City. The Municipality of Rotterdam asked Christien Meindertsma to research what
wool of this quality could be used for. It turned out to be suitable for blankets, jumpers, woolly hats, upholstery
and sound insulation. With creativity and perseverance, Christien worked together on The Soft City and ensured
that people now see Rotterdam’s sheep wool as a raw material instead of waste.

The programme is named Modem Research Papers. Description: Modem

Modem published a series of research papers that explore the impact of digitisation on various aspects of our
lives. Modem covers a wide range of topics, including the impact of AI on design and the relationship between AI
and the future of architecture. The papers were made in close collaboration with all kinds of independent artists,
writers, design studios and universities, including Harvard, MIT, UC Berkeley, The Fabricant and FutureDeluxe.
Modem shares its insights on its own platform and makes them freely available to the public, and in doing so
hopes to initiate a debate about new and upcoming technologies and our future.

AI tools exhibit serious gender and origin biases. Missjourney.ai is the first AI tool that is built to challenge
traditional patterns and stereotypes. An algorithm has been developed for this purpose that allows people from all
over the world to generate and distribute anti-stereotypical images of powerful women. The Missjourney.ai
campaign fuels an important discussion about female representation. ACE contributed creativity and technological
knowledge to the development of Missjourney.ai and TEDxAmsterdam Women highlights the theme on its
platform and during events. Missjourney.ai forms the start of the TEDxWomen annual program 'Decoding the
future', a search for inclusive technology.

The programme is named Conscious Confetti. The subtitle of the programme is No waste, wél feest!. Description: Candy Converters gives discarded wafer paper a circular life in order to minimize the use of virgin materials and maximize the reuse of materials. The paper is turned into biodegradable confetti. This conscious confetti prevents plastic pollution and food waste.

Plastic Pollution

Every year we burden the earth with about 300 million tons of plastic waste, including plastic confetti. Plastic never decays but crumbles into smaller pieces, until they are no longer visible to the naked eye. Worldwide, between 5 and 13 million tons of plastic enter the big oceans every year. Everyone knows the concept of plastic soup, but our fields are 4 to 23 times more polluted than the oceans. Research has shown that microplastics are absorbed via the root system of plants in various fruits and vegetables, and thus end up on our plates. More and more scientists are concerned about the consequences for human health. Because each of us ingests micro- and nanoplastics through the food chain, drinking water, absorption through the skin and inhalation.

Food Waste

Food is too precious to waste. Yet a large part of our food still ends up in the bin – at home and in the production chain. Did you know, for example, that we throw away about 1.3 billion tons of food worldwide every year? That's enough to feed three billion people. In other words: ten times the population of the United States! Throwing away food happens every day. A waste of food and money, of course, but the waste is much greater than that. Because producing, packaging and transporting has a major impact. For example, a kilogram of beef requires 15,000 liters of water. So when you throw out minced meat, you also throw away that water. And don't forget the plastic packaging and the CO2 emissions during transport. So if we're going to throw with things...It might as well be confetti!

Let's get waste(d)!

Residue flows from the foodindustry that are no longer suitable for consumption can be used for other purposes, so that they are not destroyed pointlessly.
Ánd being able to make a party festive without having to worry about the plastic remains.
It's possible! With Candy Converters confetti you can make a party with waste without waste. Enter the Plastic Party and let's get wasted!
